preface

i have stated in the preface to the first edition of this work and in
the zoology of the voyage of the beagle that it was in consequence of
a wish expressed by captain fitz roy of having some scientific person
on board accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own
accommodations that i volunteered my services which received through
the kindness of the hydrographer captain beaufort the sanction of the
lords of the admiralty as i feel that the opportunities which i
enjoyed of studying the natural history of the different countries we
visited have been wholly due to captain fitz roy i hope i may here be
permitted to repeat my expression of gratitude to him and to add that 
during the five years we were together i received from him the most
cordial friendship and steady assistance both to captain fitz roy and
to all the officers of the beagle i shall ever feel most thankful
for the undeviating kindness with which i was treated during our long
voyage 

this volume contains in the form of a journal a history of our
voyage and a sketch of those observations in natural history and
geology which i think will possess some interest for the general
reader i have in this edition largely condensed and corrected some
parts and have added a little to others in order to render the volume
more fitted for popular reading but i trust that naturalists will
remember that they must refer for details to the larger publications
which comprise the scientific results of the expedition the zoology
of the voyage of the beagle includes an account of the fossil mammalia 
by professor owen of the living mammalia by mr waterhouse of the
birds by mr gould of the fish by the rev l jenyns and of the
reptiles by mr bell i have appended to the descriptions of each
species an account of its habits and range these works which i owe
to the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above distinguished
authors could not have been undertaken had it not been for the
liberality of the lords commissioners of her majesty s treasury who 
through the representation of the right honourable the chancellor of
the exchequer have been pleased to grant a sum of one thousand pounds
towards defraying part of the expenses of publication 

i have myself published separate volumes on the structure and
distribution of coral reefs on the volcanic islands visited during
the voyage of the beagle and on the geology of south america the
sixth volume of the geological transactions contains two papers of
mine on the erratic boulders and volcanic phenomena of south america 
messrs waterhouse walker newman and white have published several
able papers on the insects which were collected and i trust that many
others will hereafter follow the plants from the southern parts of
america will be given by dr j hooker in his great work on the botany
of the southern hemisphere the flora of the galapagos archipelago is
the subject of a separate memoir by him in the linnean transactions 
the reverend professor henslow has published a list of the plants
collected by me at the keeling islands and the reverend j m berkeley
has described my cryptogamic plants 

i shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance which i
have received from several other naturalists in the course of this and
my other works but i must be here allowed to return my most sincere
thanks to the reverend professor henslow who when i was an
undergraduate at cambridge was one chief means of giving me a taste
for natural history who during my absence took charge of the
collections i sent home and by his correspondence directed my
endeavours and who since my return has constantly rendered me every
assistance which the kindest friend could offer 

down bromley kent june 

 i must take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to mr 
bynoe the surgeon of the beagle for his very kind attention to me
when i was ill at valparaiso

after having been twice driven back by heavy southwestern gales her
majesty s ship beagle a ten-gun brig under the command of captain
fitz roy r n sailed from devonport on the th of december 
the object of the expedition was to complete the survey of patagonia
and tierra del fuego commenced under captain king in to to
survey the shores of chile peru and of some islands in the
pacific and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the
world on the th of january we reached teneriffe but were prevented
landing by fears of our bringing the cholera the next morning we saw
the sun rise behind the rugged outline of the grand canary island and
suddenly illuminate the peak of teneriffe whilst the lower parts were
veiled in fleecy clouds this was the first of many delightful days
never to be forgotten on the th of january we anchored at
porto praya in st jago the chief island of the cape de verd
archipelago 

the neighbourhood of porto praya viewed from the sea wears a desolate
aspect the volcanic fires of a past age and the scorching heat of a
tropical sun have in most places rendered the soil unfit for
vegetation the country rises in successive steps of table-land 
interspersed with some truncate conical hills and the horizon is
bounded by an irregular chain of more lofty mountains the scene as
beheld through the hazy atmosphere of this climate is one of great
interest if indeed a person fresh from sea and who has just
walked for the first time in a grove of cocoa-nut trees can be a
judge of anything but his own happiness the island would generally be
considered as very uninteresting but to anyone accustomed only to an
english landscape the novel aspect of an utterly sterile land
possesses a grandeur which more vegetation might spoil a single green
leaf can scarcely be discovered over wide tracts of the lava plains 
yet flocks of goats together with a few cows contrive to exist it
rains very seldom but during a short portion of the year heavy
torrents fall and immediately afterwards a light vegetation springs
out of every crevice this soon withers and upon such naturally
formed hay the animals live it had not now rained for an entire year 
when the island was discovered the immediate neighbourhood of porto
praya was clothed with trees the reckless destruction of which has
caused here as at st helena and at some of the canary islands 
almost entire sterility the broad flat-bottomed valleys many of
which serve during a few days only in the season as water-courses are
clothed with thickets of leafless bushes few living creatures inhabit
these valleys the commonest bird is a kingfisher dacelo iagoensis 
which tamely sits on the branches of the castor-oil plant and thence
darts on grasshoppers and lizards it is brightly coloured but not so
beautiful as the european species in its flight manners and place of
habitation which is generally in the driest valley there is also a
wide difference 

one day two of the officers and myself rode to ribeira grande a
village a few miles eastward of porto praya until we reached the
valley of st martin the country presented its usual dull brown
appearance but here a very small rill of water produces a most
refreshing margin of luxuriant vegetation in the course of an hour we
arrived at ribeira grande and were surprised at the sight of a large
ruined fort and cathedral this little town before its harbour was
filled up was the principal place in the island it now presents a
melancholy but very picturesque appearance having procured a black
padre for a guide and a spaniard who had served in the peninsular war
as an interpreter we visited a collection of buildings of which an
ancient church formed the principal part it is here the governors and
captain-generals of the islands have been buried some of the
tombstones recorded dates of the sixteenth century 

the heraldic ornaments were the only things in this retired place that
reminded us of europe the church or chapel formed one side of a
quadrangle in the middle of which a large clump of bananas were
growing on another side was a hospital containing about a dozen
miserable-looking inmates 

we returned to the venda to eat our dinners a considerable number of
men women and children all as black as jet collected to watch us 
our companions were extremely merry and everything we said or did was
followed by their hearty laughter before leaving the town we visited
the cathedral it does not appear so rich as the smaller church but
boasts of a little organ which sent forth singularly inharmonious
cries we presented the black priest with a few shillings and the
spaniard patting him on the head said with much candour he thought
his colour made no great difference we then returned as fast as the
ponies would go to porto praya 

another day we rode to the village of st domingo situated near the
centre of the island on a small plain which we crossed a few stunted
acacias were growing their tops had been bent by the steady
trade-wind in a singular manner some of them even at right angles to
their trunks the direction of the branches was exactly n e by n 
and s w by s and these natural vanes must indicate the prevailing
direction of the force of the trade-wind the travelling had made so
little impression on the barren soil that we here missed our track 
and took that to fuentes this we did not find out till we arrived
there and we were afterwards glad of our mistake fuentes is a pretty
village with a small stream and everything appeared to prosper well 
excepting indeed that which ought to do so most its inhabitants the
black children completely naked and looking very wretched were
carrying bundles of firewood half as big as their own bodies 

near fuentes we saw a large flock of guinea-fowl probably fifty or
sixty in number they were extremely wary and could not be
approached they avoided us like partridges on a rainy day in
september running with their heads cocked up and if pursued they
readily took to the wing 

the scenery of st domingo possesses a beauty totally unexpected from
the prevalent gloomy character of the rest of the island the village
is situated at the bottom of a valley bounded by lofty and jagged
walls of stratified lava the black rocks afford a most striking
contrast with the bright green vegetation which follows the banks of a
little stream of clear water it happened to be a grand feast-day and
the village was full of people on our return we overtook a party of
about twenty young black girls dressed in excellent taste their black
skins and snow-white linen being set off by coloured turbans and large
shawls as soon as we approached near they suddenly all turned round 
and covering the path with their shawls sung with great energy a wild
song beating time with their hands upon their legs we threw them some
vintems which were received with screams of laughter and we left them
redoubling the noise of their song 

one morning the view was singularly clear the distant mountains being
projected with the sharpest outline on a heavy bank of dark blue
clouds judging from the appearance and from similar cases in
england i supposed that the air was saturated with moisture the
fact however turned out quite the contrary the hygrometer gave a
difference of degs between the temperature of the air and the
point at which dew was precipitated this difference was nearly double
that which i had observed on the previous mornings this unusual
degree of atmospheric dryness was accompanied by continual flashes of
lightning is it not an uncommon case thus to find a remarkable
degree of aerial transparency with such a state of weather 

generally the atmosphere is hazy and this is caused by the falling of
impalpably fine dust which was found to have slightly injured the
astronomical instruments the morning before we anchored at porto
praya i collected a little packet of this brown-coloured fine dust 
which appeared to have been filtered from the wind by the gauze of the
vane at the mast-head mr lyell has also given me four packets of
dust which fell on a vessel a few hundred miles northward of these
islands professor ehrenberg finds that this dust consists in
great part of infusoria with siliceous shields and of the siliceous
tissue of plants in five little packets which i sent him he has
ascertained no less than sixty-seven different organic forms the
infusoria with the exception of two marine species are all
inhabitants of fresh-water i have found no less than fifteen
different accounts of dust having fallen on vessels when far out in the
atlantic from the direction of the wind whenever it has fallen and
from its having always fallen during those months when the harmattan is
known to raise clouds of dust high into the atmosphere we may feel
sure that it all comes from africa it is however a very singular
fact that although professor ehrenberg knows many species of
infusoria peculiar to africa he finds none of these in the dust which
i sent him on the other hand he finds in it two species which
hitherto he knows as living only in south america the dust falls in
such quantities as to dirty everything on board and to hurt people s
eyes vessels even have run on shore owing to the obscurity of the
atmosphere it has often fallen on ships when several hundred and
even more than a thousand miles from the coast of africa and at points
sixteen hundred miles distant in a north and south direction in some
dust which was collected on a vessel three hundred miles from the land 
i was much surprised to find particles of stone above the thousandth of
an inch square mixed with finer matter after this fact one need not
be surprised at the diffusion of the far lighter and smaller sporules
of cryptogamic plants 

the geology of this island is the most interesting part of its natural
history on entering the harbour a perfectly horizontal white band 
in the face of the sea cliff may be seen running for some miles along
the coast and at the height of about forty-five feet above the water 
upon examination this white stratum is found to consist of calcareous
matter with numerous shells embedded most or all of which now exist on
the neighbouring coast it rests on ancient volcanic rocks and has
been covered by a stream of basalt which must have entered the sea
when the white shelly bed was lying at the bottom it is interesting
to trace the changes produced by the heat of the overlying lava on the
friable mass which in parts has been converted into a crystalline
limestone and in other parts into a compact spotted stone where the
lime has been caught up by the scoriaceous fragments of the lower
surface of the stream it is converted into groups of beautifully
radiated fibres resembling arragonite the beds of lava rise in
successive gently-sloping plains towards the interior whence the
deluges of melted stone have originally proceeded within historical
times no signs of volcanic activity have i believe been manifested
in any part of st jago even the form of a crater can but rarely be
discovered on the summits of the many red cindery hills yet the more
recent streams can be distinguished on the coast forming lines of
cliffs of less height but stretching out in advance of those belonging
to an older series the height of the cliffs thus affording a rude
measure of the age of the streams 

during our stay i observed the habits of some marine animals a large
aplysia is very common this sea-slug is about five inches long and
is of a dirty yellowish colour veined with purple on each side of the
lower surface or foot there is a broad membrane which appears
sometimes to act as a ventilator in causing a current of water to flow
over the dorsal branchiae or lungs it feeds on the delicate sea-weeds
which grow among the stones in muddy and shallow water and i found in
its stomach several small pebbles as in the gizzard of a bird this
slug when disturbed emits a very fine purplish-red fluid which
stains the water for the space of a foot around besides this means of
defence an acrid secretion which is spread over its body causes a
sharp stinging sensation similar to that produced by the physalia or
portuguese man-of-war 

i was much interested on several occasions by watching the habits of
an octopus or cuttle-fish although common in the pools of water left
by the retiring tide these animals were not easily caught by means
of their long arms and suckers they could drag their bodies into very
narrow crevices and when thus fixed it required great force to remove
them at other times they darted tail first with the rapidity of an
arrow from one side of the pool to the other at the same instant
discolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink these animals
also escape detection by a very extraordinary chameleon-like power of
changing their colour they appear to vary their tints according to the
nature of the ground over which they pass when in deep water their
general shade was brownish purple but when placed on the land or in
shallow water this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green 
the colour examined more carefully was a french grey with numerous
minute spots of bright yellow the former of these varied in intensity 
the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns these
changes were effected in such a manner that clouds varying in tint
between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown were continually
passing over the body any part being subjected to a slight shock of
galvanism became almost black a similar effect but in a less degree 
was produced by scratching the skin with a needle these clouds or
blushes as they may be called are said to be produced by the alternate
expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously
coloured fluids 

this cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act
of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom i was much
amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual 
which seemed fully aware that i was watching it remaining for a time
motionless it would then stealthily advance an inch or two like a cat
after a mouse sometimes changing its colour it thus proceeded till
having gained a deeper part it darted away leaving a dusky train of
ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled 

while looking for marine animals with my head about two feet above the
rocky shore i was more than once saluted by a jet of water 
accompanied by a slight grating noise at first i could not think what
it was but afterwards i found out that it was this cuttle-fish which 
though concealed in a hole thus often led me to its discovery that
it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt and it
appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the
tube or siphon on the under side of its body from the difficulty
which these animals have in carrying their heads they cannot crawl
with ease when placed on the ground i observed that one which i kept
in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark 

st paul s rocks in crossing the atlantic we hove-to during the
morning of february th close to the island of st paul s this
cluster of rocks is situated in degs north latitude and 
degs west longitude it is miles distant from the coast of
america and from the island of fernando noronha the highest
point is only fifty feet above the level of the sea and the entire
circumference is under three-quarters of a mile this small point
rises abruptly out of the depths of the ocean its mineralogical
constitution is not simple in some parts the rock is of a cherty in
others of a felspathic nature including thin veins of serpentine it
is a remarkable fact that all the many small islands lying far from
any continent in the pacific indian and atlantic oceans with the
exception of the seychelles and this little point of rock are i
believe composed either of coral or of erupted matter the volcanic
nature of these oceanic islands is evidently an extension of that law 
and the effect of those same causes whether chemical or mechanical 
from which it results that a vast majority of the volcanoes now in
action stand either near sea-coasts or as islands in the midst of the
sea 

the rocks of st paul appear from a distance of a brilliantly white
colour this is partly owing to the dung of a vast multitude of
seafowl and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a
pearly lustre which is intimately united to the surface of the rocks 
this when examined with a lens is found to consist of numerous
exceedingly thin layers its total thickness being about the tenth of
an inch it contains much animal matter and its origin no doubt is
due to the action of the rain or spray on the birds dung below some
small masses of guano at ascension and on the abrolhos islets i found
certain stalactitic branching bodies formed apparently in the same
manner as the thin white coating on these rocks the branching bodies
so closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae a family
of hard calcareous sea-plants that in lately looking hastily over my
collection i did not perceive the difference the globular extremities
of the branches are of a pearly texture like the enamel of teeth but
so hard as just to scratch plate-glass i may here mention that on a
part of the coast of ascension where there is a vast accumulation of
shelly sand an incrustation is deposited on the tidal rocks by the
water of the sea resembling as represented in the woodcut certain
cryptogamic plants marchantiae often seen on damp walls the surface
of the fronds is beautifully glossy and those parts formed where fully
exposed to the light are of a jet black colour but those shaded under
ledges are only grey i have shown specimens of this incrustation to
several geologists and they all thought that they were of volcanic or
igneous origin in its hardness and translucency in its polish equal
to that of the finest oliva-shell in the bad smell given out and loss
of colour under the blowpipe it shows a close similarity with living
sea-shells moreover in sea-shells it is known that the parts
habitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal are of a
paler colour than those fully exposed to the light just as is the case
with this incrustation when we remember that lime either as a
phosphate or carbonate enters into the composition of the hard parts 
such as bones and shells of all living animals it is an interesting
physiological fact to find substances harder than the enamel of
teeth and coloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh
shell reformed through inorganic means from dead organic
matter mocking also in shape some of the lower vegetable
productions 

we found on st paul s only two kinds of birds the booby and the
noddy the former is a species of gannet and the latter a tern both
are of a tame and stupid disposition and are so unaccustomed to
visitors that i could have killed any number of them with my
geological hammer the booby lays her eggs on the bare rock but the
tern makes a very simple nest with sea-weed by the side of many of
these nests a small flying-fish was placed which i suppose had been
brought by the male bird for its partner it was amusing to watch how
quickly a large and active crab graspus which inhabits the crevices
of the rock stole the fish from the side of the nest as soon as we
had disturbed the parent birds sir w symonds one of the few persons
who have landed here informs me that he saw the crabs dragging even
the young birds out of their nests and devouring them not a single
plant not even a lichen grows on this islet yet it is inhabited by
several insects and spiders the following list completes i believe 
the terrestrial fauna a fly olfersia living on the booby and a tick
which must have come here as a parasite on the birds a small brown
moth belonging to a genus that feeds on feathers a beetle quedius 
and a woodlouse from beneath the dung and lastly numerous spiders 
which i suppose prey on these small attendants and scavengers of the
water-fowl the often repeated description of the stately palm and
other noble tropical plants then birds and lastly man taking
possession of the coral islets as soon as formed in the pacific is
probably not correct i fear it destroys the poetry of this story that
feather and dirt-feeding and parasitic insects and spiders should be
the first inhabitants of newly formed oceanic land 

the smallest rock in the tropical seas by giving a foundation for the
growth of innumerable kinds of sea-weed and compound animals supports
likewise a large number of fish the sharks and the seamen in the boats
maintained a constant struggle which should secure the greater share of
the prey caught by the fishing-lines i have heard that a rock near
the bermudas lying many miles out at sea and at a considerable depth 
was first discovered by the circumstance of fish having been observed
in the neighbourhood 

fernando noronha feb th as far as i was enabled to observe 
during the few hours we stayed at this place the constitution of the
island is volcanic but probably not of a recent date the most
remarkable feature is a conical hill about one thousand feet high the
upper part of which is exceedingly steep and on one side overhangs its
base the rock is phonolite and is divided into irregular columns on
viewing one of these isolated masses at first one is inclined to
believe that it has been suddenly pushed up in a semi-fluid state at
st helena however i ascertained that some pinnacles of a nearly
similar figure and constitution had been formed by the injection of
melted rock into yielding strata which thus had formed the moulds for
these gigantic obelisks the whole island is covered with wood but
from the dryness of the climate there is no appearance of luxuriance 
half-way up the mountain some great masses of the columnar rock 
shaded by laurel-like trees and ornamented by others covered with fine
pink flowers but without a single leaf gave a pleasing effect to the
nearer parts of the scenery 

bahia or san salvador brazil feb th the day has passed
delightfully delight itself however is a weak term to express the
feelings of a naturalist who for the first time has wandered by
himself in a brazilian forest the elegance of the grasses the
novelty of the parasitical plants the beauty of the flowers the
glossy green of the foliage but above all the general luxuriance of
the vegetation filled me with admiration a most paradoxical mixture
of sound and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood the noise
from the insects is so loud that it may be heard even in a vessel
anchored several hundred yards from the shore yet within the recesses
of the forest a universal silence appears to reign to a person fond
of natural history such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure
than he can ever hope to experience again after wandering about for
some hours i returned to the landing-place but before reaching it i
was overtaken by a tropical storm i tried to find shelter under a
tree which was so thick that it would never have been penetrated by
common english rain but here in a couple of minutes a little torrent
flowed down the trunk it is to this violence of the rain that we must
attribute the verdure at the bottom of the thickest woods if the
showers were like those of a colder climate the greater part would be
absorbed or evaporated before it reached the ground i will not at
present attempt to describe the gaudy scenery of this noble bay 
because in our homeward voyage we called here a second time and i
shall then have occasion to remark on it 

along the whole coast of brazil for a length of at least miles 
and certainly for a considerable space inland wherever solid rock
occurs it belongs to a granitic formation the circumstance of this
enormous area being constituted of materials which most geologists
believe to have been crystallized when heated under pressure gives
rise to many curious reflections was this effect produced beneath the
depths of a profound ocean or did a covering of strata formerly extend
over it which has since been removed can we believe that any power 
acting for a time short of infinity could have denuded the granite
over so many thousand square leagues 

on a point not far from the city where a rivulet entered the sea i
observed a fact connected with a subject discussed by humboldt at
the cataracts of the great rivers orinoco nile and congo the
syenitic rocks are coated by a black substance appearing as if they
had been polished with plumbago the layer is of extreme thinness and
on analysis by berzelius it was found to consist of the oxides of
manganese and iron in the orinoco it occurs on the rocks periodically
washed by the floods and in those parts alone where the stream is
rapid or as the indians say the rocks are black where the waters
are white here the coating is of a rich brown instead of a black
colour and seems to be composed of ferruginous matter alone hand
specimens fail to give a just idea of these brown burnished stones
which glitter in the sun s rays they occur only within the limits of
the tidal waves and as the rivulet slowly trickles down the surf must
supply the polishing power of the cataracts in the great rivers in
like manner the rise and fall of the tide probably answer to the
periodical inundations and thus the same effects are produced under
apparently different but really similar circumstances the origin 
however of these coatings of metallic oxides which seem as if
cemented to the rocks is not understood and no reason i believe can
be assigned for their thickness remaining the same 

one day i was amused by watching the habits of the diodon antennatus 
which was caught swimming near the shore this fish with its flabby
skin is well known to possess the singular power of distending itself
into a nearly spherical form after having been taken out of water for
a short time and then again immersed in it a considerable quantity
both of water and air is absorbed by the mouth and perhaps likewise by
the branchial orifices this process is effected by two methods the
air is swallowed and is then forced into the cavity of the body its
return being prevented by a muscular contraction which is externally
visible but the water enters in a gentle stream through the mouth 
which is kept wide open and motionless this latter action must 
therefore depend on suction the skin about the abdomen is much
looser than that on the back hence during the inflation the lower
surface becomes far more distended than the upper and the fish in
consequence floats with its back downwards cuvier doubts whether the
diodon in this position is able to swim but not only can it thus move
forward in a straight line but it can turn round to either side this
latter movement is effected solely by the aid of the pectoral fins the
tail being collapsed and not used from the body being buoyed up with
so much air the branchial openings are out of water but a stream
drawn in by the mouth constantly flows through them 

the fish having remained in this distended state for a short time 
generally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the
branchial apertures and mouth it could emit at will a certain
portion of the water and it appears therefore probable that this
fluid is taken in partly for the sake of regulating its specific
gravity this diodon possessed several means of defence it could
give a severe bite and could eject water from its mouth to some
distance at the same time making a curious noise by the movement of
its jaws by the inflation of its body the papillae with which the
skin is covered become erect and pointed but the most curious
circumstance is that it secretes from the skin of its belly when
handled a most beautiful carmine-red fibrous matter which stains
ivory and paper in so permanent a manner that the tint is retained with
all its brightness to the present day i am quite ignorant of the
nature and use of this secretion i have heard from dr allan of
forres that he has frequently found a diodon floating alive and
distended in the stomach of the shark and that on several occasions
he has known it eat its way not only through the coats of the stomach 
but through the sides of the monster which has thus been killed who
would ever have imagined that a little soft fish could have destroyed
the great and savage shark 

march th we sailed from bahia a few days afterwards when not far
distant from the abrolhos islets my attention was called to a
reddish-brown appearance in the sea the whole surface of the water 
as it appeared under a weak lens seemed as if covered by chopped bits
of hay with their ends jagged these are minute cylindrical
confervae in bundles or rafts of from twenty to sixty in each mr 
berkeley informs me that they are the same species trichodesmium
erythraeum with that found over large spaces in the red sea and
whence its name of red sea is derived their numbers must be
infinite the ship passed through several bands of them one of which
was about ten yards wide and judging from the mud-like colour of the
water at least two and a half miles long in almost every long voyage
some account is given of these confervae they appear especially
common in the sea near australia and off cape leeuwin i found an
allied but smaller and apparently different species captain cook in
his third voyage remarks that the sailors gave to this appearance the
name of sea-sawdust 

near keeling atoll in the indian ocean i observed many little masses
of confervae a few inches square consisting of long cylindrical
threads of excessive thinness so as to be barely visible to the naked
eye mingled with other rather larger bodies finely conical at both
ends two of these are shown in the woodcut united together they
vary in length from to and even to of an inch in length 
and in diameter from to of an inch near one extremity of
the cylindrical part a green septum formed of granular matter and
thickest in the middle may generally be seen this i believe is the
bottom of a most delicate colourless sac composed of a pulpy
substance which lines the exterior case but does not extend within
the extreme conical points in some specimens small but perfect
spheres of brownish granular matter supplied the places of the septa 
and i observed the curious process by which they were produced the
pulpy matter of the internal coating suddenly grouped itself into
lines some of which assumed a form radiating from a common centre it
then continued with an irregular and rapid movement to contract
itself so that in the course of a second the whole was united into a
perfect little sphere which occupied the position of the septum at one
end of the now quite hollow case the formation of the granular sphere
was hastened by any accidental injury i may add that frequently a
pair of these bodies were attached to each other as represented above 
cone beside cone at that end where the septum occurs 

i will add here a few other observations connected with the
discoloration of the sea from organic causes on the coast of chile a
few leagues north of concepcion the beagle one day passed through
great bands of muddy water exactly like that of a swollen river and
again a degree south of valparaiso when fifty miles from the land 
the same appearance was still more extensive some of the water placed
in a glass was of a pale reddish tint and examined under a
microscope was seen to swarm with minute animalcula darting about and
often exploding their shape is oval and contracted in the middle by
a ring of vibrating curved ciliae it was however very difficult to
examine them with care for almost the instant motion ceased even
while crossing the field of vision their bodies burst sometimes both
ends burst at once sometimes only one and a quantity of coarse 
brownish granular matter was ejected the animal an instant before
bursting expanded to half again its natural size and the explosion
took place about fifteen seconds after the rapid progressive motion had
ceased in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a
rotatory movement on the longer axis about two minutes after any
number were isolated in a drop of water they thus perished the
animals move with the narrow apex forwards by the aid of their
vibratory ciliae and generally by rapid starts they are exceedingly
minute and quite invisible to the naked eye only covering a space
equal to the square of the thousandth of an inch their numbers were
infinite for the smallest drop of water which i could remove contained
very many in one day we passed through two spaces of water thus
stained one of which alone must have extended over several square
miles what incalculable numbers of these microscopical animals the
colour of the water as seen at some distance was like that of a river
which has flowed through a red clay district but under the shade of
the vessel s side it was quite as dark as chocolate the line where
the red and blue water joined was distinctly defined the weather for
some days previously had been calm and the ocean abounded to an
unusual degree with living creatures 

in the sea around tierra del fuego and at no great distance from the
land i have seen narrow lines of water of a bright red colour from
the number of crustacea which somewhat resemble in form large prawns 
the sealers call them whale-food whether whales feed on them i do not
know but terns cormorants and immense herds of great unwieldy seals
derive on some parts of the coast their chief sustenance from these
swimming crabs seamen invariably attribute the discoloration of the
water to spawn but i found this to be the case only on one occasion 
at the distance of several leagues from the archipelago of the
galapagos the ship sailed through three strips of a dark yellowish or
mud-like water these strips were some miles long but only a few yards
wide and they were separated from the surrounding water by a sinuous
yet distinct margin the colour was caused by little gelatinous balls 
about the fifth of an inch in diameter in which numerous minute
spherical ovules were imbedded they were of two distinct kinds one
being of a reddish colour and of a different shape from the other i
cannot form a conjecture as to what two kinds of animals these
belonged captain colnett remarks that this appearance is very common
among the galapagos islands and that the directions of the bands
indicate that of the currents in the described case however the line
was caused by the wind the only other appearance which i have to
notice is a thin oily coat on the water which displays iridescent
colours i saw a considerable tract of the ocean thus covered on the
coast of brazil the seamen attributed it to the putrefying carcase of
some whale which probably was floating at no great distance i do not
here mention the minute gelatinous particles hereafter to be referred
to which are frequently dispersed throughout the water for they are
not sufficiently abundant to create any change of colour 

there are two circumstances in the above accounts which appear
remarkable first how do the various bodies which form the bands with
defined edges keep together in the case of the prawn-like crabs 
their movements were as co-instantaneous as in a regiment of soldiers 
but this cannot happen from anything like voluntary action with the
ovules or the confervae nor is it probable among the infusoria 
secondly what causes the length and narrowness of the bands the
appearance so much resembles that which may be seen in every torrent 
where the stream uncoils into long streaks the froth collected in the
eddies that i must attribute the effect to a similar action either of
the currents of the air or sea under this supposition we must believe
that the various organized bodies are produced in certain favourable
places and are thence removed by the set of either wind or water i
confess however there is a very great difficulty in imagining any one
spot to be the birthplace of the millions of millions of animalcula and
confervae for whence come the germs at such points the parent bodies
having been distributed by the winds and waves over the immense ocean 
but on no other hypothesis can i understand their linear grouping i
may add that scoresby remarks that green water abounding with pelagic
animals is invariably found in a certain part of the arctic sea 

 i state this on the authority of dr e dieffenbach in his german
translation of the first edition of this journal 

 the cape de verd islands were discovered in there was a
tombstone of a bishop with the date of and a crest of a hand and
dagger dated 

 i must take this opportunity of acknowledging the great kindness
with which this illustrious naturalist has examined many of my
specimens i have sent june a full account of the falling of
this dust to the geological society 

 so named according to patrick symes s nomenclature 

 see encyclop of anat and physiol article cephalopoda

 mr horner and sir david brewster have described philosophical
transactions p a singular artificial substance resembling
shell it is deposited in fine transparent highly polished 
brown-coloured laminae possessing peculiar optical properties on the
inside of a vessel in which cloth first prepared with glue and then
with lime is made to revolve rapidly in water it is much softer 
more transparent and contains more animal matter than the natural
incrustation at ascension but we here again see the strong tendency
which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid
substance allied to shell

april th to july th a few days after our arrival i became
acquainted with an englishman who was going to visit his estate 
situated rather more than a hundred miles from the capital to the
northward of cape frio i gladly accepted his kind offer of allowing
me to accompany him 

april th our party amounted to seven the first stage was very
interesting the day was powerfully hot and as we passed through the
woods everything was motionless excepting the large and brilliant
butterflies which lazily fluttered about the view seen when crossing
the hills behind praia grande was most beautiful the colours were
intense and the prevailing tint a dark blue the sky and the calm
waters of the bay vied with each other in splendour after passing
through some cultivated country we entered a forest which in the
grandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded we arrived by midday
at ithacaia this small village is situated on a plain and round the
central house are the huts of the negroes these from their regular
form and position reminded me of the drawings of the hottentot
habitations in southern africa as the moon rose early we determined
to start the same evening for our sleeping-place at the lagoa marica 
as it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive bare and
steep hills of granite which are so common in this country this spot
is notorious from having been for a long time the residence of some
runaway slaves who by cultivating a little ground near the top 
contrived to eke out a subsistence at length they were discovered 
and a party of soldiers being sent the whole were seized with the
exception of one old woman who sooner than again be led into slavery 
dashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain in a roman
matron this would have been called the noble love of freedom in a poor
negress it is mere brutal obstinacy we continued riding for some
hours for the few last miles the road was intricate and it passed
through a desert waste of marshes and lagoons the scene by the dimmed
light of the moon was most desolate a few fireflies flitted by us 
and the solitary snipe as it rose uttered its plaintive cry the
distant and sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the
night 

april th we left our miserable sleeping-place before sunrise the
road passed through a narrow sandy plain lying between the sea and the
interior salt lagoons the number of beautiful fishing birds such as
egrets and cranes and the succulent plants assuming most fantastical
forms gave to the scene an interest which it would not otherwise have
possessed the few stunted trees were loaded with parasitical plants 
among which the beauty and delicious fragrance of some of the orchideae
were most to be admired as the sun rose the day became extremely hot 
and the reflection of the light and heat from the white sand was very
distressing we dined at mandetiba the thermometer in the shade being
 degs the beautiful view of the distant wooded hills reflected in
the perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon quite refreshed us as
the venda here was a very good one and i have the pleasant but
rare remembrance of an excellent dinner i will be grateful and
presently describe it as the type of its class these houses are
often large and are built of thick upright posts with boughs
interwoven and afterwards plastered they seldom have floors and
never glazed windows but are generally pretty well roofed universally
the front part is open forming a kind of verandah in which tables and
benches are placed the bed-rooms join on each side and here the
passenger may sleep as comfortably as he can on a wooden platform 
covered by a thin straw mat the venda stands in a courtyard where
the horses are fed on first arriving it was our custom to unsaddle
the horses and give them their indian corn then with a low bow to
ask the senhor to do us the favour to give up something to eat 
 anything you choose sir was his usual answer for the few first
times vainly i thanked providence for having guided us to so good a
man the conversation proceeding the case universally became
deplorable any fish can you do us the favour of giving oh no 
sir any soup no sir any bread oh no sir any
dried meat oh no sir if we were lucky by waiting a couple of
hours we obtained fowls rice and farinha it not unfrequently
happened that we were obliged to kill with stones the poultry for
our own supper when thoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger we
timorously hinted that we should be glad of our meal the pompous and
 though true most unsatisfactory answer was it will be ready when it
is ready if we had dared to remonstrate any further we should have
been told to proceed on our journey as being too impertinent the
hosts are most ungracious and disagreeable in their manners their
houses and their persons are often filthily dirty the want of the
accommodation of forks knives and spoons is common and i am sure no
cottage or hovel in england could be found in a state so utterly
destitute of every comfort at campos novos however we fared
sumptuously having rice and fowls biscuit wine and spirits for
dinner coffee in the evening and fish with coffee for breakfast all
this with good food for the horses only cost s d per head yet
the host of this venda being asked if he knew anything of a whip which
one of the party had lost gruffly answered how should i know why
did you not take care of it i suppose the dogs have eaten it 

leaving mandetiba we continued to pass through an intricate wilderness
of lakes in some of which were fresh in others salt water shells of
the former kinds i found a limnaea in great numbers in a lake into
which the inhabitants assured me that the sea enters once a year and
sometimes oftener and makes the water quite salt i have no doubt
many interesting facts in relation to marine and fresh water animals 
might be observed in this chain of lagoons which skirt the coast of
brazil m gay has stated that he found in the neighbourhood of
rio shells of the marine genera solen and mytilus and fresh water
ampullariae living together in brackish water i also frequently
observed in the lagoon near the botanic garden where the water is only
a little less salt than in the sea a species of hydrophilus very
similar to a water-beetle common in the ditches of england in the same
lake the only shell belonged to a genus generally found in estuaries 

leaving the coast for a time we again entered the forest the trees
were very lofty and remarkable compared with those of europe from
the whiteness of their trunks i see by my note-book wonderful and
beautiful flowering parasites invariably struck me as the most novel
object in these grand scenes travelling onwards we passed through
tracts of pasturage much injured by the enormous conical ants nests 
which were nearly twelve feet high they gave to the plain exactly the
appearance of the mud volcanos at jorullo as figured by humboldt we
arrived at engenhodo after it was dark having been ten hours on
horseback i never ceased during the whole journey to be surprised
at the amount of labour which the horses were capable of enduring they
appeared also to recover from any injury much sooner than those of our
english breed the vampire bat is often the cause of much trouble by
biting the horses on their withers the injury is generally not so
much owing to the loss of blood as to the inflammation which the
pressure of the saddle afterwards produces the whole circumstance has
lately been doubted in england i was therefore fortunate in being
present when one desmodus d orbignyi wat was actually caught on a
horse s back we were bivouacking late one evening near coquimbo in
chile when my servant noticing that one of the horses was very
restive went to see what was the matter and fancying he could
distinguish something suddenly put his hand on the beast s withers 
and secured the vampire in the morning the spot where the bite had
been inflicted was easily distinguished from being slightly swollen and
bloody the third day afterwards we rode the horse without any ill
effects 

april th after three days travelling we arrived at socego the
estate of senhor manuel figuireda a relation of one of our party the
house was simple and though like a barn in form was well suited to
the climate in the sitting-room gilded chairs and sofas were oddly
contrasted with the whitewashed walls thatched roof and windows
without glass the house together with the granaries the stables 
and workshops for the blacks who had been taught various trades 
formed a rude kind of quadrangle in the centre of which a large pile
of coffee was drying these buildings stand on a little hill 
overlooking the cultivated ground and surrounded on every side by a
wall of dark green luxuriant forest the chief produce of this part of
the country is coffee each tree is supposed to yield annually on an
average two pounds but some give as much as eight mandioca or
cassada is likewise cultivated in great quantity every part of this
plant is useful the leaves and stalks are eaten by the horses and the
roots are ground into a pulp which when pressed dry and baked forms
the farinha the principal article of sustenance in the brazils it is
a curious though well-known fact that the juice of this most
nutritious plant is highly poisonous a few years ago a cow died at
this fazenda in consequence of having drunk some of it senhor
figuireda told me that he had planted the year before one bag of
feijao or beans and three of rice the former of which produced
eighty and the latter three hundred and twenty fold the pasturage
supports a fine stock of cattle and the woods are so full of game that
a deer had been killed on each of the three previous days this
profusion of food showed itself at dinner where if the tables did not
groan the guests surely did for each person is expected to eat of
every dish one day having as i thought nicely calculated so that
nothing should go away untasted to my utter dismay a roast turkey and
a pig appeared in all their substantial reality during the meals it
was the employment of a man to drive out of the room sundry old hounds 
and dozens of little black children which crawled in together at
every opportunity as long as the idea of slavery could be banished 
there was something exceedingly fascinating in this simple and
patriarchal style of living it was such a perfect retirement and
independence from the rest of the world 

as soon as any stranger is seen arriving a large bell is set tolling 
and generally some small cannon are fired the event is thus announced
to the rocks and woods but to nothing else one morning i walked out
an hour before daylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene at
last the silence was broken by the morning hymn raised on high by the
whole body of the blacks and in this manner their daily work is
generally begun on such fazendas as these i have no doubt the slaves
pass happy and contented lives on saturday and sunday they work for
themselves and in this fertile climate the labour of two days is
sufficient to support a man and his family for the whole week 

april th leaving socego we rode to another estate on the rio
macae which was the last patch of cultivated ground in that direction 
the estate was two and a half miles long and the owner had forgotten
how many broad only a very small piece had been cleared yet almost
every acre was capable of yielding all the various rich productions of
a tropical land considering the enormous area of brazil the
proportion of cultivated ground can scarcely be considered as anything 
compared to that which is left in the state of nature at some future
age how vast a population it will support during the second day s
journey we found the road so shut up that it was necessary that a man
should go ahead with a sword to cut away the creepers the forest
abounded with beautiful objects among which the tree ferns though not
large were from their bright green foliage and the elegant curvature
of their fronds most worthy of admiration in the evening it rained
very heavily and although the thermometer stood at degs i felt
very cold as soon as the rain ceased it was curious to observe the
extraordinary evaporation which commenced over the whole extent of the
forest at the height of a hundred feet the hills were buried in a
dense white vapour which rose like columns of smoke from the most
thickly wooded parts and especially from the valleys i observed this
phenomenon on several occasions i suppose it is owing to the large
surface of foliage previously heated by the sun s rays 

while staying at this estate i was very nearly being an eye-witness to
one of those atrocious acts which can only take place in a slave
country owing to a quarrel and a lawsuit the owner was on the point
of taking all the women and children from the male slaves and selling
them separately at the public auction at rio interest and not any
feeling of compassion prevented this act indeed i do not believe
the inhumanity of separating thirty families who had lived together
for many years even occurred to the owner yet i will pledge myself 
that in humanity and good feeling he was superior to the common run of
men it may be said there exists no limit to the blindness of interest
and selfish habit i may mention one very trifling anecdote which at
the time struck me more forcibly than any story of cruelty i was
crossing a ferry with a negro who was uncommonly stupid in
endeavouring to make him understand i talked loud and made signs in
doing which i passed my hand near his face he i suppose thought i
was in a passion and was going to strike him for instantly with a
frightened look and half-shut eyes he dropped his hands i shall
never forget my feelings of surprise disgust and shame at seeing a
great powerful man afraid even to ward off a blow directed as he
thought at his face this man had been trained to a degradation lower
than the slavery of the most helpless animal 

april th in returning we spent two days at socego and i employed
them in collecting insects in the forest the greater number of trees 
although so lofty are not more than three or four feet in
circumference there are of course a few of much greater dimensions 
senhor manuel was then making a canoe feet in length from a solid
trunk which had originally been feet long and of great thickness 
the contrast of palm trees growing amidst the common branching kinds 
never fails to give the scene an intertropical character here the
woods were ornamented by the cabbage palm one of the most beautiful of
its family with a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the
two hands it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty
feet above the ground the woody creepers themselves covered by other
creepers were of great thickness some which i measured were two feet
in circumference many of the older trees presented a very curious
appearance from the tresses of a liana hanging from their boughs and
resembling bundles of hay if the eye was turned from the world of
foliage above to the ground beneath it was attracted by the extreme
elegance of the leaves of the ferns and mimosae the latter in some
parts covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high in
walking across these thick beds of mimosae a broad track was marked by
the change of shade produced by the drooping of their sensitive
petioles it is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in
these grand scenes but it is not possible to give an adequate idea of
the higher feelings of wonder astonishment and devotion which fill
and elevate the mind 

april th leaving socego during the two first days we retraced our
steps it was very wearisome work as the road generally ran across a
glaring hot sandy plain not far from the coast i noticed that each
time the horse put its foot on the fine siliceous sand a gentle
chirping noise was produced on the third day we took a different
line and passed through the gay little village of madre de deos this
is one of the principal lines of road in brazil yet it was in so bad a
state that no wheeled vehicle excepting the clumsy bullock-wagon 
could pass along in our whole journey we did not cross a single
bridge built of stone and those made of logs of wood were frequently
so much out of repair that it was necessary to go on one side to avoid
them all distances are inaccurately known the road is often marked
by crosses in the place of milestones to signify where human blood
has been spilled on the evening of the rd we arrived at rio having
finished our pleasant little excursion 

during the remainder of my stay at rio i resided in a cottage at
botofogo bay it was impossible to wish for anything more delightful
than thus to spend some weeks in so magnificent a country in england
any person fond of natural history enjoys in his walks a great
advantage by always having something to attract his attention but in
these fertile climates teeming with life the attractions are so
numerous that he is scarcely able to walk at all 

the few observations which i was enabled to make were almost
exclusively confined to the invertebrate animals the existence of a
division of the genus planaria which inhabits the dry land interested
me much these animals are of so simple a structure that cuvier has
arranged them with the intestinal worms though never found within the
bodies of other animals numerous species inhabit both salt and fresh
water but those to which i allude were found even in the drier parts
of the forest beneath logs of rotten wood on which i believe they
feed in general form they resemble little slugs but are very much
narrower in proportion and several of the species are beautifully
coloured with longitudinal stripes their structure is very simple 
near the middle of the under or crawling surface there are two small
transverse slits from the anterior one of which a funnel-shaped and
highly irritable mouth can be protruded for some time after the rest
of the animal was completely dead from the effects of salt water or any
other cause this organ still retained its vitality 

i found no less than twelve different species of terrestrial planariae
in different parts of the southern hemisphere some specimens which
i obtained at van dieman s land i kept alive for nearly two months 
feeding them on rotten wood having cut one of them transversely into
two nearly equal parts in the course of a fortnight both had the shape
of perfect animals i had however so divided the body that one of
the halves contained both the inferior orifices and the other in
consequence none in the course of twenty-five days from the
operation the more perfect half could not have been distinguished from
any other specimen the other had increased much in size and towards
its posterior end a clear space was formed in the parenchymatous mass 
in which a rudimentary cup-shaped mouth could clearly be distinguished 
on the under surface however no corresponding slit was yet open if
the increased heat of the weather as we approached the equator had
not destroyed all the individuals there can be no doubt that this last
step would have completed its structure although so well-known an
experiment it was interesting to watch the gradual production of every
essential organ out of the simple extremity of another animal it is
extremely difficult to preserve these planariae as soon as the
cessation of life allows the ordinary laws of change to act their
entire bodies become soft and fluid with a rapidity which i have never
seen equalled 

i first visited the forest in which these planariae were found in
company with an old portuguese priest who took me out to hunt with him 
the sport consisted in turning into the cover a few dogs and then
patiently waiting to fire at any animal which might appear we were
accompanied by the son of a neighbouring farmer a good specimen of a
wild brazilian youth he was dressed in a tattered old shirt and
trousers and had his head uncovered he carried an old-fashioned gun
and a large knife the habit of carrying the knife is universal and
in traversing a thick wood it is almost necessary on account of the
creeping plants the frequent occurrence of murder may be partly
attributed to this habit the brazilians are so dexterous with the
knife that they can throw it to some distance with precision and with
sufficient force to cause a fatal wound i have seen a number of
little boys practising this art as a game of play and from their skill
in hitting an upright stick they promised well for more earnest
attempts my companion the day before had shot two large bearded
monkeys these animals have prehensile tails the extremity of which 
even after death can support the whole weight of the body one of
them thus remained fast to a branch and it was necessary to cut down a
large tree to procure it this was soon effected and down came tree
and monkey with an awful crash our day s sport besides the monkey 
was confined to sundry small green parrots and a few toucans i
profited however by my acquaintance with the portuguese padre for on
another occasion he gave me a fine specimen of the yagouaroundi cat 

every one has heard of the beauty of the scenery near botofogo the
house in which i lived was seated close beneath the well-known mountain
of the corcovado it has been remarked with much truth that abruptly
conical hills are characteristic of the formation which humboldt
designates as gneiss-granite nothing can be more striking than the
effect of these huge rounded masses of naked rock rising out of the
most luxuriant vegetation 

i was often interested by watching the clouds which rolling in from
seaward formed a bank just beneath the highest point of the corcovado 
this mountain like most others when thus partly veiled appeared to
rise to a far prouder elevation than its real height of feet mr 
daniell has observed in his meteorological essays that a cloud
sometimes appears fixed on a mountain summit while the wind continues
to blow over it the same phenomenon here presented a slightly
different appearance in this case the cloud was clearly seen to curl
over and rapidly pass by the summit and yet was neither diminished
nor increased in size the sun was setting and a gentle southerly
breeze striking against the southern side of the rock mingled its
current with the colder air above and the vapour was thus condensed 
but as the light wreaths of cloud passed over the ridge and came
within the influence of the warmer atmosphere of the northern sloping
bank they were immediately re-dissolved 

the climate during the months of may and june or the beginning of
winter was delightful the mean temperature from observations taken
at nine o clock both morning and evening was only degs it often
rained heavily but the drying southerly winds soon again rendered the
walks pleasant one morning in the course of six hours inches of
rain fell as this storm passed over the forests which surround the
corcovado the sound produced by the drops pattering on the countless
multitude of leaves was very remarkable it could be heard at the
distance of a quarter of a mile and was like the rushing of a great
body of water after the hotter days it was delicious to sit quietly
in the garden and watch the evening pass into night nature in these
climes chooses her vocalists from more humble performers than in
europe a small frog of the genus hyla sits on a blade of grass
about an inch above the surface of the water and sends forth a
pleasing chirp when several are together they sing in harmony on
different notes i had some difficulty in catching a specimen of this
frog the genus hyla has its toes terminated by small suckers and i
found this animal could crawl up a pane of glass when placed
absolutely perpendicular various cicidae and crickets at the same
time keep up a ceaseless shrill cry but which softened by the
distance is not unpleasant every evening after dark this great
concert commenced and often have i sat listening to it until my
attention has been drawn away by some curious passing insect 

at these times the fireflies are seen flitting about from hedge to
hedge on a dark night the light can be seen at about two hundred
paces distant it is remarkable that in all the different kinds of
glowworms shining elaters and various marine animals such as the
crustacea medusae nereidae a coralline of the genus clytia and
pyrosma which i have observed the light has been of a well-marked
green colour all the fireflies which i caught here belonged to the
lampyridae in which family the english glowworm is included and the
greater number of specimens were of lampyris occidentalis i found
that this insect emitted the most brilliant flashes when irritated in
the intervals the abdominal rings were obscured the flash was almost
co-instantaneous in the two rings but it was just perceptible first in
the anterior one the shining matter was fluid and very adhesive 
little spots where the skin had been torn continued bright with a
slight scintillation whilst the uninjured parts were obscured when
the insect was decapitated the rings remained uninterruptedly bright 
but not so brilliant as before local irritation with a needle always
increased the vividness of the light the rings in one instance
retained their luminous property nearly twenty-four hours after the
death of the insect from these facts it would appear probable that
the animal has only the power of concealing or extinguishing the light
for short intervals and that at other times the display is
involuntary on the muddy and wet gravel-walks i found the larvae of
this lampyris in great numbers they resembled in general form the
female of the english glowworm these larvae possessed but feeble
luminous powers very differently from their parents on the slightest
touch they feigned death and ceased to shine nor did irritation excite
any fresh display i kept several of them alive for some time their
tails are very singular organs for they act by a well-fitted
contrivance as suckers or organs of attachment and likewise as
reservoirs for saliva or some such fluid i repeatedly fed them on
raw meat and i invariably observed that every now and then the
extremity of the tail was applied to the mouth and a drop of fluid
exuded on the meat which was then in the act of being consumed the
tail notwithstanding so much practice does not seem to be able to
find its way to the mouth at least the neck was always touched first 
and apparently as a guide 

when we were at bahia an elater or beetle pyrophorus luminosus 
illig seemed the most common luminous insect the light in this case
was also rendered more brilliant by irritation i amused myself one
day by observing the springing powers of this insect which have not 
as it appears to me been properly described the elater when
placed on its back and preparing to spring moved its head and thorax
backwards so that the pectoral spine was drawn out and rested on the
edge of its sheath the same backward movement being continued the
spine by the full action of the muscles was bent like a spring and
the insect at this moment rested on the extremity of its head and
wing-cases the effort being suddenly relaxed the head and thorax flew
up and in consequence the base of the wing-cases struck the
supporting surface with such force that the insect by the reaction was
jerked upwards to the height of one or two inches the projecting
points of the thorax and the sheath of the spine served to steady the
whole body during the spring in the descriptions which i have read 
sufficient stress does not appear to have been laid on the elasticity
of the spine so sudden a spring could not be the result of simple
muscular contraction without the aid of some mechanical contrivance 

on several occasions i enjoyed some short but most pleasant excursions
in the neighbouring country one day i went to the botanic garden 
where many plants well known for their great utility might be seen
growing the leaves of the camphor pepper cinnamon and clove trees
were delightfully aromatic and the bread-fruit the jaca and the
mango vied with each other in the magnificence of their foliage the
landscape in the neighbourhood of bahia almost takes its character from
the two latter trees before seeing them i had no idea that any trees
could cast so black a shade on the ground both of them bear to the
evergreen vegetation of these climates the same kind of relation which
laurels and hollies in england do to the lighter green of the deciduous
trees it may be observed that the houses within the tropics are
surrounded by the most beautiful forms of vegetation because many of
them are at the same time most useful to man who can doubt that these
qualities are united in the banana the cocoa-nut the many kinds of
palm the orange and the bread-fruit tree 

during this day i was particularly struck with a remark of humboldt s 
who often alludes to the thin vapour which without changing the
transparency of the air renders its tints more harmonious and softens
its effects this is an appearance which i have never observed in the
temperate zones the atmosphere seen through a short space of half or
three-quarters of a mile was perfectly lucid but at a greater
distance all colours were blended into a most beautiful haze of a pale
french grey mingled with a little blue the condition of the
atmosphere between the morning and about noon when the effect was most
evident had undergone little change excepting in its dryness in the
interval the difference between the dew point and temperature had
increased from to degs 

on another occasion i started early and walked to the gavia or topsail
mountain the air was delightfully cool and fragrant and the drops of
dew still glittered on the leaves of the large liliaceous plants which
shaded the streamlets of clear water sitting down on a block of
granite it was delightful to watch the various insects and birds as
they flew past the humming-bird seems particularly fond of such shady
retired spots whenever i saw these little creatures buzzing round a
flower with their wings vibrating so rapidly as to be scarcely
visible i was reminded of the sphinx moths their movements and habits
are indeed in many respects very similar 

following a pathway i entered a noble forest and from a height of
five or six hundred feet one of those splendid views was presented 
which are so common on every side of rio at this elevation the
landscape attains its most brilliant tint and every form every shade 
so completely surpasses in magnificence all that the european has ever
beheld in his own country that he knows not how to express his
feelings the general effect frequently recalled to my mind the gayest
scenery of the opera-house or the great theatres i never returned
from these excursions empty-handed this day i found a specimen of a
curious fungus called hymenophallus most people know the english
phallus which in autumn taints the air with its odious smell this 
however as the entomologist is aware is to some of our beetles a
delightful fragrance so was it here for a strongylus attracted by
the odour alighted on the fungus as i carried it in my hand we here
see in two distant countries a similar relation between plants and
insects of the same families though the species of both are different 
when man is the agent in introducing into a country a new species this
relation is often broken as one instance of this i may mention that
the leaves of the cabbages and lettuces which in england afford food
to such a multitude of slugs and caterpillars in the gardens near rio
are untouched 

during our stay at brazil i made a large collection of insects a few
general observations on the comparative importance of the different
orders may be interesting to the english entomologist the large and
brilliantly coloured lepidoptera bespeak the zone they inhabit far
more plainly than any other race of animals i allude only to the
butterflies for the moths contrary to what might have been expected
from the rankness of the vegetation certainly appeared in much fewer
numbers than in our own temperate regions i was much surprised at the
habits of papilio feronia this butterfly is not uncommon and
generally frequents the orange-groves although a high flier yet it
very frequently alights on the trunks of trees on these occasions its
head is invariably placed downwards and its wings are expanded in a
horizontal plane instead of being folded vertically as is commonly
the case this is the only butterfly which i have ever seen that uses
its legs for running not being aware of this fact the insect more
than once as i cautiously approached with my forceps shuffled on one
side just as the instrument was on the point of closing and thus
escaped but a far more singular fact is the power which this species
possesses of making a noise several times when a pair probably
male and female were chasing each other in an irregular course they
passed within a few yards of me and i distinctly heard a clicking
noise similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a
spring catch the noise was continued at short intervals and could be
distinguished at about twenty yards distance i am certain there is no
error in the observation 

i was disappointed in the general aspect of the coleoptera the number
of minute and obscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great the
cabinets of europe can as yet boast only of the larger species from
tropical climates it is sufficient to disturb the composure of an
entomologist s mind to look forward to the future dimensions of a
complete catalogue the carnivorous beetles or carabidae appear in
extremely few numbers within the tropics this is the more remarkable
when compared to the case of the carnivorous quadrupeds which are so
abundant in hot countries i was struck with this observation both on
entering brazil and when i saw the many elegant and active forms of
the harpalidae re-appearing on the temperate plains of la plata do
the very numerous spiders and rapacious hymenoptera supply the place of
the carnivorous beetles the carrion-feeders and brachelytra are very
uncommon on the other hand the rhyncophora and chrysomelidae all of
which depend on the vegetable world for subsistence are present in
astonishing numbers i do not here refer to the number of different
species but to that of the individual insects for on this it is that
the most striking character in the entomology of different countries
depends the orders orthoptera and hemiptera are particularly
numerous as likewise is the stinging division of the hymenoptera the
bees perhaps being excepted a person on first entering a tropical
forest is astonished at the labours of the ants well-beaten paths
branch off in every direction on which an army of never-failing
foragers may be seen some going forth and others returning burdened
with pieces of green leaf often larger than their own bodies 

a small dark-coloured ant sometimes migrates in countless numbers one
day at bahia my attention was drawn by observing many spiders 
cockroaches and other insects and some lizards rushing in the
greatest agitation across a bare piece of ground a little way behind 
every stalk and leaf was blackened by a small ant the swarm having
crossed the bare space divided itself and descended an old wall by
this means many insects were fairly enclosed and the efforts which the
poor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death
were wonderful when the ants came to the road they changed their
course and in narrow files reascended the wall having placed a small
stone so as to intercept one of the lines the whole body attacked it 
and then immediately retired shortly afterwards another body came to
the charge and again having failed to make any impression this line
of march was entirely given up by going an inch round the file might
have avoided the stone and this doubtless would have happened if it
had been originally there but having been attacked the lion-hearted
little warriors scorned the idea of yielding 

certain wasp-like insects which construct in the corners of the
verandahs clay cells for their larvae are very numerous in the
neighbourhood of rio these cells they stuff full of half-dead spiders
and caterpillars which they seem wonderfully to know how to sting to
that degree as to leave them paralysed but alive until their eggs are
hatched and the larvae feed on the horrid mass of powerless 
half-killed victims a sight which has been described by an
enthusiastic naturalist as curious and pleasing i was much
interested one day by watching a deadly contest between a pepsis and a
large spider of the genus lycosa the wasp made a sudden dash at its
prey and then flew away the spider was evidently wounded for trying
to escape it rolled down a little slope but had still strength
sufficient to crawl into a thick tuft of grass the wasp soon
returned and seemed surprised at not immediately finding its victim 
it then commenced as regular a hunt as ever hound did after fox making
short semicircular casts and all the time rapidly vibrating its wings
and antennae the spider though well concealed was soon discovered 
and the wasp evidently still afraid of its adversary s jaws after
much manoeuvring inflicted two stings on the under side of its thorax 
at last carefully examining with its antennae the now motionless
spider it proceeded to drag away the body but i stopped both tyrant
and prey 

the number of spiders in proportion to other insects is here compared
with england very much larger perhaps more so than with any other
division of the articulate animals the variety of species among the
jumping spiders appears almost infinite the genus or rather family 
of epeira is here characterized by many singular forms some species
have pointed coriaceous shells others enlarged and spiny tibiae every
path in the forest is barricaded with the strong yellow web of a
species belonging to the same division with the epeira clavipes of
fabricius which was formerly said by sloane to make in the west
indies webs so strong as to catch birds a small and pretty kind of
spider with very long fore-legs and which appears to belong to an
undescribed genus lives as a parasite on almost every one of these
webs i suppose it is too insignificant to be noticed by the great
epeira and is therefore allowed to prey on the minute insects which 
adhering to the lines would otherwise be wasted when frightened 
this little spider either feigns death by extending its front legs or
suddenly drops from the web a large epeira of the same division with
epeira tuberculata and conica is extremely common especially in dry
situations its web which is generally placed among the great leaves
of the common agave is sometimes strengthened near the centre by a
pair or even four zigzag ribbons which connect two adjoining rays 
when any large insect as a grasshopper or wasp is caught the spider 
by a dexterous movement makes it revolve very rapidly and at the same
time emitting a band of threads from its spinners soon envelops its
prey in a case like the cocoon of a silkworm the spider now examines
the powerless victim and gives the fatal bite on the hinder part of
its thorax then retreating patiently waits till the poison has taken
effect the virulence of this poison may be judged of from the fact
that in half a minute i opened the mesh and found a large wasp quite
lifeless this epeira always stands with its head downwards near the
centre of the web when disturbed it acts differently according to
circumstances if there is a thicket below it suddenly falls down and
i have distinctly seen the thread from the spinners lengthened by the
animal while yet stationary as preparatory to its fall if the ground
is clear beneath the epeira seldom falls but moves quickly through a
central passage from one to the other side when still further
disturbed it practises a most curious manoeuvre standing in the
middle it violently jerks the web which it attached to elastic twigs 
till at last the whole acquires such a rapid vibratory movement that
even the outline of the spider s body becomes indistinct 

it is well known that most of the british spiders when a large insect
is caught in their webs endeavour to cut the lines and liberate their
prey to save their nets from being entirely spoiled i once however 
saw in a hothouse in shropshire a large female wasp caught in the
irregular web of a quite small spider and this spider instead of
cutting the web most perseveringly continued to entangle the body and
especially the wings of its prey the wasp at first aimed in vain
repeated thrusts with its sting at its little antagonist pitying the
wasp after allowing it to struggle for more than an hour i killed it
and put it back into the web the spider soon returned and an hour
afterwards i was much surprised to find it with its jaws buried in the
orifice through which the sting is protruded by the living wasp i
drove the spider away two or three times but for the next twenty-four
hours i always found it again sucking at the same place the spider
became much distended by the juices of its prey which was many times
larger than itself 

i may here just mention that i found near st fe bajada many large
black spiders with ruby-coloured marks on their backs having
gregarious habits the webs were placed vertically as is invariably
the case with the genus epeira they were separated from each other by
a space of about two feet but were all attached to certain common
lines which were of great length and extended to all parts of the
community in this manner the tops of some large bushes were
encompassed by the united nets azara has described a gregarious
spider in paraguay which walckanaer thinks must be a theridion but
probably it is an epeira and perhaps even the same species with mine 
i cannot however recollect seeing a central nest as large as a hat 
in which during autumn when the spiders die azara says the eggs are
deposited as all the spiders which i saw were of the same size they
must have been nearly of the same age this gregarious habit in so
typical a genus as epeira among insects which are so bloodthirsty and
solitary that even the two sexes attack each other is a very singular
fact 

in a lofty valley of the cordillera near mendoza i found another
spider with a singularly-formed web strong lines radiated in a
vertical plane from a common centre where the insect had its station 
but only two of the rays were connected by a symmetrical mesh-work so
that the net instead of being as is generally the case circular 
consisted of a wedge-shaped segment all the webs were similarly
constructed

july th in the morning we got under way and stood out of the
splendid harbour of rio de janeiro in our passage to the plata we
saw nothing particular excepting on one day a great shoal of
porpoises many hundreds in number the whole sea was in places
furrowed by them and a most extraordinary spectacle was presented as
hundreds proceeding together by jumps in which their whole bodies
were exposed thus cut the water when the ship was running nine knots
an hour these animals could cross and recross the bows with the
greatest of ease and then dash away right ahead as soon as we
entered the estuary of the plata the weather was very unsettled one
dark night we were surrounded by numerous seals and penguins which
made such strange noises that the officer on watch reported he could
hear the cattle bellowing on shore on a second night we witnessed a
splendid scene of natural fireworks the mast-head and yard-arm-ends
shone with st elmo s light and the form of the vane could almost be
traced as if it had been rubbed with phosphorus the sea was so
highly luminous that the tracks of the penguins were marked by a fiery
wake and the darkness of the sky was momentarily illuminated by the
most vivid lightning 

when within the mouth of the river i was interested by observing how
slowly the waters of the sea and river mixed the latter muddy and
discoloured from its less specific gravity floated on the surface of
the salt water this was curiously exhibited in the wake of the
vessel where a line of blue water was seen mingling in little eddies 
with the adjoining fluid 

july th we anchored at monte video the beagle was employed in
surveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of america south of
the plata during the two succeeding years to prevent useless
repetitions i will extract those parts of my journal which refer to
the same districts without always attending to the order in which we
visited them 

maldonado is situated on the northern bank of the plata and not very
far from the mouth of the estuary it is a most quiet forlorn little
town built as is universally the case in these countries with the
streets running at right angles to each other and having in the middle
a large plaza or square which from its size renders the scantiness
of the population more evident it possesses scarcely any trade the
exports being confined to a few hides and living cattle the
inhabitants are chiefly landowners together with a few shopkeepers and
the necessary tradesmen such as blacksmiths and carpenters who do
nearly all the business for a circuit of fifty miles round the town
is separated from the river by a band of sand-hillocks about a mile
broad it is surrounded on all other sides by an open
slightly-undulating country covered by one uniform layer of fine green
turf on which countless herds of cattle sheep and horses graze 
there is very little land cultivated even close to the town a few
hedges made of cacti and agave mark out where some wheat or indian
corn has been planted the features of the country are very similar
along the whole northern bank of the plata the only difference is 
that here the granitic hills are a little bolder the scenery is very
uninteresting there is scarcely a house an enclosed piece of ground 
or even a tree to give it an air of cheerfulness yet after being
imprisoned for some time in a ship there is a charm in the unconfined
feeling of walking over boundless plains of turf moreover if your
view is limited to a small space many objects possess beauty some of
the smaller birds are brilliantly coloured and the bright green sward 
browsed short by the cattle is ornamented by dwarf flowers among
which a plant looking like the daisy claimed the place of an old
friend what would a florist say to whole tracts so thickly covered
by the verbena melindres as even at a distance to appear of the most
gaudy scarlet 

i stayed ten weeks at maldonado in which time a nearly perfect
collection of the animals birds and reptiles was procured before
making any observations respecting them i will give an account of a
little excursion i made as far as the river polanco which is about
seventy miles distant in a northerly direction i may mention as a
proof how cheap everything is in this country that i paid only two
dollars a day or eight shillings for two men together with a troop
of about a dozen riding-horses my companions were well armed with
pistols and sabres a precaution which i thought rather unnecessary but
the first piece of news we heard was that the day before a traveller
from monte video had been found dead on the road with his throat cut 
this happened close to a cross the record of a former murder 

on the first night we slept at a retired little country-house and
there i soon found out that i possessed two or three articles 
especially a pocket compass which created unbounded astonishment in
every house i was asked to show the compass and by its aid together
with a map to point out the direction of various places it excited
the liveliest admiration that i a perfect stranger should know the
road for direction and road are synonymous in this open country to
places where i had never been at one house a young woman who was ill
in bed sent to entreat me to come and show her the compass if their
surprise was great mine was greater to find such ignorance among
people who possessed their thousands of cattle and estancias of
great extent it can only be accounted for by the circumstance that
this retired part of the country is seldom visited by foreigners i
was asked whether the earth or sun moved whether it was hotter or
colder to the north where spain was and many other such questions 
the greater number of the inhabitants had an indistinct idea that
england london and north america were different names for the same
place but the better informed well knew that london and north america
were separate countries close together and that england was a large
town in london i carried with me some promethean matches which i
ignited by biting it was thought so wonderful that a man should strike
fire with his teeth that it was usual to collect the whole family to
see it i was once offered a dollar for a single one washing my face
in the morning caused much speculation at the village of las minas a
superior tradesman closely cross-questioned me about so singular a
practice and likewise why on board we wore our beards for he had
heard from my guide that we did so he eyed me with much suspicion 
perhaps he had heard of ablutions in the mahomedan religion and
knowing me to be a heretick probably he came to the conclusion that
all hereticks were turks it is the general custom in this country to
ask for a night s lodging at the first convenient house the
astonishment at the compass and my other feats of jugglery was to a
certain degree advantageous as with that and the long stories my
guides told of my breaking stones knowing venomous from harmless
snakes collecting insects etc i repaid them for their hospitality 
i am writing as if i had been among the inhabitants of central africa 
banda oriental would not be flattered by the comparison but such were
my feelings at the time 

the next day we rode to the village of las minas the country was
rather more hilly but otherwise continued the same an inhabitant of
the pampas no doubt would have considered it as truly alpine the
country is so thinly inhabited that during the whole day we scarcely
met a single person las minas is much smaller even than maldonado it
is seated on a little plain and is surrounded by low rocky mountains 
it is of the usual symmetrical form and with its whitewashed church
standing in the centre had rather a pretty appearance the
outskirting houses rose out of the plain like isolated beings without
the accompaniment of gardens or courtyards this is generally the case
in the country and all the houses have in consequence an
uncomfortable aspect at night we stopped at a pulperia or
drinking-shop during the evening a great number of gauchos came in to
drink spirits and smoke cigars their appearance is very striking they
are generally tall and handsome but with a proud and dissolute
expression of countenance they frequently wear their moustaches and
long black hair curling down their backs with their brightly coloured
garments great spurs clanking about their heels and knives stuck as
daggers and often so used at their waists they look a very different
race of men from what might be expected from their name of gauchos or
simple countrymen their politeness is excessive they never drink
their spirits without expecting you to taste it but whilst making
their exceedingly graceful bow they seem quite as ready if occasion
offered to cut your throat 

on the third day we pursued rather an irregular course as i was
employed in examining some beds of marble on the fine plains of turf
we saw many ostriches struthio rhea some of the flocks contained as
many as twenty or thirty birds these when standing on any little
eminence and seen against the clear sky presented a very noble
appearance i never met with such tame ostriches in any other part of
the country it was easy to gallop up within a short distance of them 
but then expanding their wings they made all sail right before the
wind and soon left the horse astern 

at night we came to the house of don juan fuentes a rich landed
proprietor but not personally known to either of my companions on
approaching the house of a stranger it is usual to follow several
little points of etiquette riding up slowly to the door the
salutation of ave maria is given and until somebody comes out and asks
you to alight it is not customary even to get off your horse the
formal answer of the owner is sin pecado concebida that is 
conceived without sin having entered the house some general
conversation is kept up for a few minutes till permission is asked to
pass the night there this is granted as a matter of course the
stranger then takes his meals with the family and a room is assigned
him where with the horsecloths belonging to his recado or saddle of
the pampas he makes his bed it is curious how similar circumstances
produce such similar results in manners at the cape of good hope the
same hospitality and very nearly the same points of etiquette are
universally observed the difference however between the character
of the spaniard and that of the dutch boer is shown by the former
never asking his guest a single question beyond the strictest rule of
politeness whilst the honest dutchman demands where he has been where
he is going what is his business and even how many brothers sisters 
or children he may happen to have 

shortly after our arrival at don juan s one of the largest herds of
cattle was driven in towards the house and three beasts were picked
out to be slaughtered for the supply of the establishment these
half-wild cattle are very active and knowing full well the fatal lazo 
they led the horses a long and laborious chase after witnessing the
rude wealth displayed in the number of cattle men and horses don
juan s miserable house was quite curious the floor consisted of
hardened mud and the windows were without glass the sitting-room
boasted only of a few of the roughest chairs and stools with a couple
of tables the supper although several strangers were present 
consisted of two huge piles one of roast beef the other of boiled 
with some pieces of pumpkin besides this latter there was no other
vegetable and not even a morsel of bread for drinking a large
earthenware jug of water served the whole party yet this man was the
owner of several square miles of land of which nearly every acre would
produce corn and with a little trouble all the common vegetables 
the evening was spent in smoking with a little impromptu singing 
accompanied by the guitar the signoritas all sat together in one
corner of the room and did not sup with the men 

so many works have been written about these countries that it is
almost superfluous to describe either the lazo or the bolas the lazo
consists of a very strong but thin well-plaited rope made of raw
hide one end is attached to the broad surcingle which fastens
together the complicated gear of the recado or saddle used in the
pampas the other is terminated by a small ring of iron or brass by
which a noose can be formed the gaucho when he is going to use the
lazo keeps a small coil in his bridle-hand and in the other holds the
running noose which is made very large generally having a diameter of
about eight feet this he whirls round his head and by the dexterous
movement of his wrist keeps the noose open then throwing it he
causes it to fall on any particular spot he chooses the lazo when
not used is tied up in a small coil to the after part of the recado 
the bolas or balls are of two kinds the simplest which is chiefly
used for catching ostriches consists of two round stones covered with
leather and united by a thin plaited thong about eight feet long the
other kind differs only in having three balls united by the thongs to a
common centre the gaucho holds the smallest of the three in his hand 
and whirls the other two round and round his head then taking aim 
sends them like chain shot revolving through the air the balls no
sooner strike any object than winding round it they cross each
other and become firmly hitched the size and weight of the balls
vary according to the purpose for which they are made when of stone 
although not larger than an apple they are sent with such force as
sometimes to break the leg even of a horse i have seen the balls made
of wood and as large as a turnip for the sake of catching these
animals without injuring them the balls are sometimes made of iron 
and these can be hurled to the greatest distance the main difficulty
in using either lazo or bolas is to ride so well as to be able at full
speed and while suddenly turning about to whirl them so steadily
round the head as to take aim on foot any person would soon learn the
art one day as i was amusing myself by galloping and whirling the
balls round my head by accident the free one struck a bush and its
revolving motion being thus destroyed it immediately fell to the
ground and like magic caught one hind leg of my horse the other
ball was then jerked out of my hand and the horse fairly secured 
luckily he was an old practised animal and knew what it meant 
otherwise he would probably have kicked till he had thrown himself
down the gauchos roared with laughter they cried out that they had
seen every sort of animal caught but had never before seen a man
caught by himself 

during the two succeeding days i reached the furthest point which i
was anxious to examine the country wore the same aspect till at last
the fine green turf became more wearisome than a dusty turnpike road 
we everywhere saw great numbers of partridges nothura major these
birds do not go in coveys nor do they conceal themselves like the
english kind it appears a very silly bird a man on horseback by
riding round and round in a circle or rather in a spire so as to
approach closer each time may knock on the head as many as he pleases 
the more common method is to catch them with a running noose or little
lazo made of the stem of an ostrich s feather fastened to the end of
a long stick a boy on a quiet old horse will frequently thus catch
thirty or forty in a day in arctic north america the indians
catch the varying hare by walking spirally round and round it when on
its form the middle of the day is reckoned the best time when the sun
is high and the shadow of the hunter not very long 

on our return to maldonado we followed rather a different line of
road near pan de azucar a landmark well known to all those who have
sailed up the plata i stayed a day at the house of a most hospitable
old spaniard early in the morning we ascended the sierra de las
animas by the aid of the rising sun the scenery was almost
picturesque to the westward the view extended over an immense level
plain as far as the mount at monte video and to the eastward over
the mammillated country of maldonado on the summit of the mountain
there were several small heaps of stones which evidently had lain
there for many years my companion assured me that they were the work
of the indians in the old time the heaps were similar but on a much
smaller scale to those so commonly found on the mountains of wales 
the desire to signalize any event on the highest point of the
neighbouring land seems an universal passion with mankind at the
present day not a single indian either civilized or wild exists in
this part of the province nor am i aware that the former inhabitants
have left behind them any more permanent records than these
insignificant piles on the summit of the sierra de las animas 


the general and almost entire absence of trees in banda oriental is
remarkable some of the rocky hills are partly covered by thickets 
and on the banks of the larger streams especially to the north of las
minas willow-trees are not uncommon near the arroyo tapes i heard of
a wood of palms and one of these trees of considerable size i saw
near the pan de azucar in lat degs these and the trees planted
by the spaniards offer the only exceptions to the general scarcity of
wood among the introduced kinds may be enumerated poplars olives 
peach and other fruit trees the peaches succeed so well that they
afford the main supply of firewood to the city of buenos ayres 
extremely level countries such as the pampas seldom appear favourable
to the growth of trees this may possibly be attributed either to the
force of the winds or the kind of drainage in the nature of the
land however around maldonado no such reason is apparent the rocky
mountains afford protected situations enjoying various kinds of soil 
streamlets of water are common at the bottoms of nearly every valley 
and the clayey nature of the earth seems adapted to retain moisture it
has been inferred with much probability that the presence of woodland
is generally determined by the annual amount of moisture yet in
this province abundant and heavy rain falls during the winter and the
summer though dry is not so in any excessive degree we see
nearly the whole of australia covered by lofty trees yet that country
possesses a far more arid climate hence we must look to some other
and unknown cause 

confining our view to south america we should certainly be tempted to
believe that trees flourished only under a very humid climate for the
limit of the forest-land follows in a most remarkable manner that of
the damp winds in the southern part of the continent where the
western gales charged with moisture from the pacific prevail every
island on the broken west coast from lat degs to the extreme
point of tierra del fuego is densely covered by impenetrable forests 
on the eastern side of the cordillera over the same extent of
latitude where a blue sky and a fine climate prove that the atmosphere
has been deprived of its moisture by passing over the mountains the
arid plains of patagonia support a most scanty vegetation in the more
northern parts of the continent within the limits of the constant
south-eastern trade-wind the eastern side is ornamented by magnificent
forests whilst the western coast from lat degs s to lat 
degs s may be described as a desert on this western coast 
northward of lat degs s where the trade-wind loses its
regularity and heavy torrents of rain fall periodically the shores of
the pacific so utterly desert in peru assume near cape blanco the
character of luxuriance so celebrated at guyaquil and panama hence in
the southern and northern parts of the continent the forest and desert
lands occupy reversed positions with respect to the cordillera and
these positions are apparently determined by the direction of the
prevalent winds in the middle of the continent there is a broad
intermediate band including central chile and the provinces of la
plata where the rain-bringing winds have not to pass over lofty
mountains and where the land is neither a desert nor covered by
forests but even the rule if confined to south america of trees
flourishing only in a climate rendered humid by rain-bearing winds has
a strongly marked exception in the case of the falkland islands these
islands situated in the same latitude with tierra del fuego and only
between two and three hundred miles distant from it having a nearly
similar climate with a geological formation almost identical with
favourable situations and the same kind of peaty soil yet can boast of
few plants deserving even the title of bushes whilst in tierra del
fuego it is impossible to find an acre of land not covered by the
densest forest in this case both the direction of the heavy gales of
wind and of the currents of the sea are favourable to the transport of
seeds from tierra del fuego as is shown by the canoes and trunks of
trees drifted from that country and frequently thrown on the shores of
the western falkland hence perhaps it is that there are many plants
in common to the two countries but with respect to the trees of tierra
del fuego even attempts made to transplant them have failed 

during our stay at maldonado i collected several quadrupeds eighty
kinds of birds and many reptiles including nine species of snakes of
the indigenous mammalia the only one now left of any size which is
common is the cervus campestris this deer is exceedingly abundant 
often in small herds throughout the countries bordering the plata and
in northern patagonia if a person crawling close along the ground 
slowly advances towards a herd the deer frequently out of curiosity 
approach to reconnoitre him i have by this means killed from one
spot three out of the same herd although so tame and inquisitive 
yet when approached on horseback they are exceedingly wary in this
country nobody goes on foot and the deer knows man as its enemy only
when he is mounted and armed with the bolas at bahia blanca a recent
establishment in northern patagonia i was surprised to find how little
the deer cared for the noise of a gun one day i fired ten times from
within eighty yards at one animal and it was much more startled at the
ball cutting up the ground than at the report of the rifle my powder
being exhausted i was obliged to get up to my shame as a sportsman be
it spoken though well able to kill birds on the wing and halloo till
the deer ran away 

the most curious fact with respect to this animal is the
overpoweringly strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the buck 
it is quite indescribable several times whilst skinning the specimen
which is now mounted at the zoological museum i was almost overcome by
nausea i tied up the skin in a silk pocket-handkerchief and so
carried it home this handkerchief after being well washed i
continually used and it was of course as repeatedly washed yet every
time for a space of one year and seven months when first unfolded i
distinctly perceived the odour this appears an astonishing instance
of the permanence of some matter which nevertheless in its nature must
be most subtile and volatile frequently when passing at the distance
of half a mile to leeward of a herd i have perceived the whole air
tainted with the effluvium i believe the smell from the buck is most
powerful at the period when its horns are perfect or free from the
hairy skin when in this state the meat is of course quite
uneatable but the gauchos assert that if buried for some time in
fresh earth the taint is removed i have somewhere read that the
islanders in the north of scotland treat the rank carcasses of the
fish-eating birds in the same manner 

the order rodentia is here very numerous in species of mice alone i
obtained no less than eight kinds the largest gnawing animal in
the world the hydrochaerus capybara the water-hog is here also
common one which i shot at monte video weighed ninety-eight pounds 
its length from the end of the snout to the stump-like tail was three
feet two inches and its girth three feet eight these great rodents
occasionally frequent the islands in the mouth of the plata where the
water is quite salt but are far more abundant on the borders of
fresh-water lakes and rivers near maldonado three or four generally
live together in the daytime they either lie among the aquatic
plants or openly feed on the turf plain when viewed at a
distance from their manner of walking and colour they resemble pigs 
but when seated on their haunches and attentively watching any object
with one eye they reassume the appearance of their congeners cavies
and rabbits both the front and side view of their head has quite a
ludicrous aspect from the great depth of their jaw these animals at
maldonado were very tame by cautiously walking i approached within
three yards of four old ones this tameness may probably be accounted
for by the jaguar having been banished for some years and by the
gaucho not thinking it worth his while to hunt them as i approached
nearer and nearer they frequently made their peculiar noise which is a
low abrupt grunt not having much actual sound but rather arising from
the sudden expulsion of air the only noise i know at all like it is
the first hoarse bark of a large dog having watched the four from
almost within arm s length and they me for several minutes they
rushed into the water at full gallop with the greatest impetuosity and
emitted at the same time their bark after diving a short distance
they came again to the surface but only just showed the upper part of
their heads when the female is swimming in the water and has young
ones they are said to sit on her back these animals are easily killed
in numbers but their skins are of trifling value and the meat is very
indifferent on the islands in the rio parana they are exceedingly
abundant and afford the ordinary prey to the jaguar 

the tucutuco ctenomys brasiliensis is a curious small animal which
may be briefly described as a gnawer with the habits of a mole it is
extremely numerous in some parts of the country but it is difficult to
be procured and never i believe comes out of the ground it throws
up at the mouth of its burrows hillocks of earth like those of the
mole but smaller considerable tracts of country are so completely
undermined by these animals that horses in passing over sink above
their fetlocks the tucutucos appear to a certain degree to be
gregarious the man who procured the specimens for me had caught six
together and he said this was a common occurrence they are nocturnal
in their habits and their principal food is the roots of plants which
are the object of their extensive and superficial burrows this animal
is universally known by a very peculiar noise which it makes when
beneath the ground a person the first time he hears it is much
surprised for it is not easy to tell whence it comes nor is it
possible to guess what kind of creature utters it the noise consists
in a short but not rough nasal grunt which is monotonously repeated
about four times in quick succession the name tucutuco is given in
imitation of the sound where this animal is abundant it may be heard
at all times of the day and sometimes directly beneath one s feet 
when kept in a room the tucutucos move both slowly and clumsily which
appears owing to the outward action of their hind legs and they are
quite incapable from the socket of the thigh-bone not having a certain
ligament of jumping even the smallest vertical height they are very
stupid in making any attempt to escape when angry or frightened they
utter the tucutuco of those i kept alive several even the first day 
became quite tame not attempting to bite or to run away others were a
little wilder 

the man who caught them asserted that very many are invariably found
blind a specimen which i preserved in spirits was in this state mr 
reid considers it to be the effect of inflammation in the nictitating
membrane when the animal was alive i placed my finger within half an
inch of its head and not the slightest notice was taken it made its
way however about the room nearly as well as the others considering
the strictly subterranean habits of the tucutuco the blindness though
so common cannot be a very serious evil yet it appears strange that
any animal should possess an organ frequently subject to be injured 
lamarck would have been delighted with this fact had he known it when
speculating probably with more truth than usual with him on the
gradually acquired blindness of the asphalax a gnawer living under
ground and of the proteus a reptile living in dark caverns filled
with water in both of which animals the eye is in an almost
rudimentary state and is covered by a tendinous membrane and skin in
the common mole the eye is extraordinarily small but perfect though
many anatomists doubt whether it is connected with the true optic
nerve its vision must certainly be imperfect though probably useful
to the animal when it leaves its burrow in the tucutuco which i
believe never comes to the surface of the ground the eye is rather
larger but often rendered blind and useless though without apparently
causing any inconvenience to the animal no doubt lamarck would have
said that the tucutuco is now passing into the state of the asphalax
and proteus 

birds of many kinds are extremely abundant on the undulating grassy
plains around maldonado there are several species of a family allied
in structure and manners to our starling one of these molothrus
niger is remarkable from its habits several may often be seen
standing together on the back of a cow or horse and while perched on a
hedge pluming themselves in the sun they sometimes attempt to sing 
or rather to hiss the noise being very peculiar resembling that of
bubbles of air passing rapidly from a small orifice under water so as
to produce an acute sound according to azara this bird like the
cuckoo deposits its eggs in other birds nests i was several times
told by the country people that there certainly is some bird having
this habit and my assistant in collecting who is a very accurate
person found a nest of the sparrow of this country zonotrichia
matutina with one egg in it larger than the others and of a
different colour and shape in north america there is another species
of molothrus m pecoris which has a similar cuckoo-like habit and
which is most closely allied in every respect to the species from the
plata even in such trifling peculiarities as standing on the backs of
cattle it differs only in being a little smaller and in its plumage
and eggs being of a slightly different shade of colour this close
agreement in structure and habits in representative species coming
from opposite quarters of a great continent always strikes one as
interesting though of common occurrence 

mr swainson has well remarked that with the exception of the
molothrus pecoris to which must be added the m niger the cuckoos are
the only birds which can be called truly parasitical namely such as
 fasten themselves as it were on another living animal whose animal
heat brings their young into life whose food they live upon and whose
death would cause theirs during the period of infancy it is
remarkable that some of the species but not all both of the cuckoo
and molothrus should agree in this one strange habit of their
parasitical propagation whilst opposed to each other in almost every
other habit the molothrus like our starling is eminently sociable 
and lives on the open plains without art or disguise the cuckoo as
every one knows is a singularly shy bird it frequents the most
retired thickets and feeds on fruit and caterpillars in structure
also these two genera are widely removed from each other many
theories even phrenological theories have been advanced to explain
the origin of the cuckoo laying its eggs in other birds nests m 
prevost alone i think has thrown light by his observations on
this puzzle he finds that the female cuckoo which according to most
observers lays at least from four to six eggs must pair with the male
each time after laying only one or two eggs now if the cuckoo was
obliged to sit on her own eggs she would either have to sit on all
together and therefore leave those first laid so long that they
probably would become addled or she would have to hatch separately
each egg or two eggs as soon as laid but as the cuckoo stays a
shorter time in this country than any other migratory bird she
certainly would not have time enough for the successive hatchings 
hence we can perceive in the fact of the cuckoo pairing several times 
and laying her eggs at intervals the cause of her depositing her eggs
in other birds nests and leaving them to the care of foster-parents 
i am strongly inclined to believe that this view is correct from
having been independently led as we shall hereafter see to an
analogous conclusion with regard to the south american ostrich the
females of which are parasitical if i may so express it on each
other each female laying several eggs in the nests of several other
females and the male ostrich undertaking all the cares of incubation 
like the strange foster-parents with the cuckoo 

i will mention only two other birds which are very common and render
themselves prominent from their habits the saurophagus sulphuratus is
typical of the great american tribe of tyrant-flycatchers in its
structure it closely approaches the true shrikes but in its habits may
be compared to many birds i have frequently observed it hunting a
field hovering over one spot like a hawk and then proceeding on to
another when seen thus suspended in the air it might very readily at
a short distance be mistaken for one of the rapacious order its stoop 
however is very inferior in force and rapidity to that of a hawk at
other times the saurophagus haunts the neighbourhood of water and
there like a kingfisher remaining stationary it catches any small
fish which may come near the margin these birds are not unfrequently
kept either in cages or in courtyards with their wings cut they soon
become tame and are very amusing from their cunning odd manners which
were described to me as being similar to those of the common magpie 
their flight is undulatory for the weight of the head and bill appears
too great for the body in the evening the saurophagus takes its stand
on a bush often by the roadside and continually repeats without a
change a shrill and rather agreeable cry which somewhat resembles
articulate words the spaniards say it is like the words bien te veo 
 i see you well and accordingly have given it this name 

a mocking-bird mimus orpheus called by the inhabitants calandria is
remarkable from possessing a song far superior to that of any other
bird in the country indeed it is nearly the only bird in south
america which i have observed to take its stand for the purpose of
singing the song may be compared to that of the sedge warbler but is
more powerful some harsh notes and some very high ones being mingled
with a pleasant warbling it is heard only during the spring at
other times its cry is harsh and far from harmonious near maldonado
these birds were tame and bold they constantly attended the country
houses in numbers to pick the meat which was hung up on the posts or
walls if any other small bird joined the feast the calandria soon
chased it away on the wide uninhabited plains of patagonia another
closely allied species o patagonica of d orbigny which frequents the
valleys clothed with spiny bushes is a wilder bird and has a slightly
different tone of voice it appears to me a curious circumstance as
showing the fine shades of difference in habits that judging from this
latter respect alone when i first saw this second species i thought
it was different from the maldonado kind having afterwards procured a
specimen and comparing the two without particular care they appeared
so very similar that i changed my opinion but now mr gould says that
they are certainly distinct a conclusion in conformity with the
trifling difference of habit of which of course he was not aware 

the number tameness and disgusting habits of the carrion-feeding
hawks of south america make them pre-eminently striking to any one
accustomed only to the birds of northern europe in this list may be
included four species of the caracara or polyborus the turkey buzzard 
the gallinazo and the condor the caracaras are from their
structure placed among the eagles we shall soon see how ill they
become so high a rank in their habits they well supply the place of
our carrion-crows magpies and ravens a tribe of birds widely
distributed over the rest of the world but entirely absent in south
america to begin with the polyborus brasiliensis this is a common
bird and has a wide geographical range it is most numerous on the
grassy savannahs of la plata where it goes by the name of carrancha 
and is far from unfrequent throughout the sterile plains of patagonia 
in the desert between the rivers negro and colorado numbers constantly
attend the line of road to devour the carcasses of the exhausted
animals which chance to perish from fatigue and thirst although thus
common in these dry and open countries and likewise on the arid shores
of the pacific it is nevertheless found inhabiting the damp impervious
forests of west patagonia and tierra del fuego the carranchas 
together with the chimango constantly attend in numbers the estancias
and slaughtering-houses if an animal dies on the plain the gallinazo
commences the feast and then the two species of polyborus pick the
bones clean these birds although thus commonly feeding together are
far from being friends when the carrancha is quietly seated on the
branch of a tree or on the ground the chimango often continues for a
long time flying backwards and forwards up and down in a semicircle 
trying each time at the bottom of the curve to strike its larger
relative the carrancha takes little notice except by bobbing its
head although the carranchas frequently assemble in numbers they are
not gregarious for in desert places they may be seen solitary or more
commonly by pairs 

the carranchas are said to be very crafty and to steal great numbers
of eggs they attempt also together with the chimango to pick off
the scabs from the sore backs of horses and mules the poor animal on
the one hand with its ears down and its back arched and on the
other the hovering bird eyeing at the distance of a yard the
disgusting morsel form a picture which has been described by captain
head with his own peculiar spirit and accuracy these false eagles
most rarely kill any living bird or animal and their vulture-like 
necrophagous habits are very evident to any one who has fallen asleep
on the desolate plains of patagonia for when he wakes he will see on
each surrounding hillock one of these birds patiently watching him
with an evil eye it is a feature in the landscape of these countries 
which will be recognised by every one who has wandered over them if a
party of men go out hunting with dogs and horses they will be
accompanied during the day by several of these attendants after
feeding the uncovered craw protrudes at such times and indeed
generally the carrancha is an inactive tame and cowardly bird its
flight is heavy and slow like that of an english rook it seldom
soars but i have twice seen one at a great height gliding through the
air with much ease it runs in contradistinction to hopping but not
quite so quickly as some of its congeners at times the carrancha is
noisy but is not generally so its cry is loud very harsh and
peculiar and may be likened to the sound of the spanish guttural g 
followed by a rough double r r when uttering this cry it elevates its
head higher and higher till at last with its beak wide open the
crown almost touches the lower part of the back this fact which has
been doubted is quite true i have seen them several times with their
heads backwards in a completely inverted position to these
observations i may add on the high authority of azara that the
carrancha feeds on worms shells slugs grasshoppers and frogs that
it destroys young lambs by tearing the umbilical cord and that it
pursues the gallinazo till that bird is compelled to vomit up the
carrion it may have recently gorged lastly azara states that several
carranchas five or six together will unite in chase of large birds 
even such as herons all these facts show that it is a bird of very
versatile habits and considerable ingenuity 

the polyborus chimango is considerably smaller than the last species 
it is truly omnivorous and will eat even bread and i was assured that
it materially injures the potato crops in chiloe by stocking up the
roots when first planted of all the carrion-feeders it is generally
the last which leaves the skeleton of a dead animal and may often be
seen within the ribs of a cow or horse like a bird in a cage another
species is the polyborus novae zelandiae which is exceedingly common
in the falkland islands these birds in many respects resemble in
their habits the carranchas they live on the flesh of dead animals
and on marine productions and on the ramirez rocks their whole
sustenance must depend on the sea they are extraordinarily tame and
fearless and haunt the neighborhood of houses for offal if a hunting
party kills an animal a number soon collect and patiently await 
standing on the ground on all sides after eating their uncovered
craws are largely protruded giving them a disgusting appearance they
readily attack wounded birds a cormorant in this state having taken to
the shore was immediately seized on by several and its death hastened
by their blows the beagle was at the falklands only during the
summer but the officers of the adventure who were there in the
winter mention many extraordinary instances of the boldness and
rapacity of these birds they actually pounced on a dog that was lying
fast asleep close by one of the party and the sportsmen had difficulty
in preventing the wounded geese from being seized before their eyes it
is said that several together in this respect resembling the
carranchas wait at the mouth of a rabbit-hole and together seize on
the animal when it comes out they were constantly flying on board the
vessel when in the harbour and it was necessary to keep a good look
out to prevent the leather being torn from the rigging and the meat or
game from the stern these birds are very mischievous and inquisitive 
they will pick up almost anything from the ground a large black glazed
hat was carried nearly a mile as was a pair of the heavy balls used in
catching cattle mr usborne experienced during the survey a more
severe loss in their stealing a small kater s compass in a red morocco
leather case which was never recovered these birds are moreover 
quarrelsome and very passionate tearing up the grass with their bills
from rage they are not truly gregarious they do not soar and their
flight is heavy and clumsy on the ground they run extremely fast very
much like pheasants they are noisy uttering several harsh cries one
of which is like that of the english rook hence the sealers always
call them rooks it is a curious circumstance that when crying out 
they throw their heads upwards and backwards after the same manner as
the carrancha they build in the rocky cliffs of the sea-coast but
only on the small adjoining islets and not on the two main islands 
this is a singular precaution in so tame and fearless a bird the
sealers say that the flesh of these birds when cooked is quite white 
and very good eating but bold must the man be who attempts such a meal 

we have now only to mention the turkey-buzzard vultur aura and the
gallinazo the former is found wherever the country is moderately
damp from cape horn to north america differently from the polyborus
brasiliensis and chimango it has found its way to the falkland
islands the turkey-buzzard is a solitary bird or at most goes in
pairs it may at once be recognised from a long distance by its
lofty soaring and most elegant flight it is well known to be a true
carrion-feeder on the west coast of patagonia among the
thickly-wooded islets and broken land it lives exclusively on what the
sea throws up and on the carcasses of dead seals wherever these
animals are congregated on the rocks there the vultures may be seen 
the gallinazo cathartes atratus has a different range from the last
species as it never occurs southward of lat degs azara states
that there exists a tradition that these birds at the time of the
conquest were not found near monte video but that they subsequently
followed the inhabitants from more northern districts at the present
day they are numerous in the valley of the colorado which is three
hundred miles due south of monte video it seems probable that this
additional migration has happened since the time of azara the
gallinazo generally prefers a humid climate or rather the
neighbourhood of fresh water hence it is extremely abundant in brazil
and la plata while it is never found on the desert and arid plains of
northern patagonia excepting near some stream these birds frequent
the whole pampas to the foot of the cordillera but i never saw or
heard of one in chile in peru they are preserved as scavengers these
vultures certainly may be called gregarious for they seem to have
pleasure in society and are not solely brought together by the
attraction of a common prey on a fine day a flock may often be
observed at a great height each bird wheeling round and round without
closing its wings in the most graceful evolutions this is clearly
performed for the mere pleasure of the exercise or perhaps is
connected with their matrimonial alliances 

i have now mentioned all the carrion-feeders excepting the condor an
account of which will be more appropriately introduced when we visit a
country more congenial to its habits than the plains of la plata 


in a broad band of sand-hillocks which separate the laguna del potrero
from the shores of the plata at the distance of a few miles from
maldonado i found a group of those vitrified siliceous tubes which
are formed by lightning entering loose sand these tubes resemble in
every particular those from drigg in cumberland described in the
geological transactions the sand-hillocks of maldonado not being
protected by vegetation are constantly changing their position from
this cause the tubes projected above the surface and numerous
fragments lying near showed that they had formerly been buried to a
greater depth four sets entered the sand perpendicularly by working
with my hands i traced one of them two feet deep and some fragments
which evidently had belonged to the same tube when added to the other
part measured five feet three inches the diameter of the whole tube
was nearly equal and therefore we must suppose that originally it
extended to a much greater depth these dimensions are however small 
compared to those of the tubes from drigg one of which was traced to a
depth of not less than thirty feet 

the internal surface is completely vitrified glossy and smooth a
small fragment examined under the microscope appeared from the number
of minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles like an assay fused
before the blowpipe the sand is entirely or in greater part 
siliceous but some points are of a black colour and from their glossy
surface possess a metallic lustre the thickness of the wall of the
tube varies from a thirtieth to a twentieth of an inch and
occasionally even equals a tenth on the outside the grains of sand
are rounded and have a slightly glazed appearance i could not
distinguish any signs of crystallization in a similar manner to that
described in the geological transactions the tubes are generally
compressed and have deep longitudinal furrows so as closely to
resemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk or the bark of the elm or cork
tree their circumference is about two inches but in some fragments 
which are cylindrical and without any furrows it is as much as four
inches the compression from the surrounding loose sand acting while
the tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat has
evidently caused the creases or furrows judging from the uncompressed
fragments the measure or bore of the lightning if such a term may be
used must have been about one inch and a quarter at paris m 
hachette and m beudant succeeded in making tubes in most
respects similar to these fulgurites by passing very strong shocks of
galvanism through finely-powdered glass when salt was added so as to
increase its fusibility the tubes were larger in every dimension they
failed both with powdered felspar and quartz one tube formed with
pounded glass was very nearly an inch long namely and had an
internal diameter of of an inch when we hear that the strongest
battery in paris was used and that its power on a substance of such
easy fusibility as glass was to form tubes so diminutive we must feel
greatly astonished at the force of a shock of lightning which 
striking the sand in several places has formed cylinders in one
instance of at least thirty feet long and having an internal bore 
where not compressed of full an inch and a half and this in a
material so extraordinarily refractory as quartz 

the tubes as i have already remarked enter the sand nearly in a
vertical direction one however which was less regular than the
others deviated from a right line at the most considerable bend to
the amount of thirty-three degrees from this same tube two small
branches about a foot apart were sent off one pointed downwards and
the other upwards this latter case is remarkable as the electric
fluid must have turned back at the acute angle of degs to the line
of its main course besides the four tubes which i found vertical and
traced beneath the surface there were several other groups of
fragments the original sites of which without doubt were near all
occurred in a level area of shifting sand sixty yards by twenty 
situated among some high sand-hillocks and at the distance of about
half a mile from a chain of hills four or five hundred feet in height 
the most remarkable circumstance as it appears to me in this case as
well as in that of drigg and in one described by m ribbentrop in
germany is the number of tubes found within such limited spaces at
drigg within an area of fifteen yards three were observed and the
same number occurred in germany in the case which i have described 
certainly more than four existed within the space of the sixty by
twenty yards as it does not appear probable that the tubes are
produced by successive distinct shocks we must believe that the
lightning shortly before entering the ground divides itself into
separate branches 

the neighbourhood of the rio plata seems peculiarly subject to electric
phenomena in the year one of the most destructive
thunderstorms perhaps on record happened at buenos ayres thirty-seven
places within the city were struck by lightning and nineteen people
killed from facts stated in several books of travels i am inclined
to suspect that thunderstorms are very common near the mouths of great
rivers is it not possible that the mixture of large bodies of fresh
and salt water may disturb the electrical equilibrium even during our
occasional visits to this part of south america we heard of a ship 
two churches and a house having been struck both the church and the
house i saw shortly afterwards the house belonged to mr hood the
consul-general at monte video some of the effects were curious the
paper for nearly a foot on each side of the line where the bell-wires
had run was blackened the metal had been fused and although the
room was about fifteen feet high the globules dropping on the chairs
and furniture had drilled in them a chain of minute holes a part of
the wall was shattered as if by gunpowder and the fragments had been
blown off with force sufficient to dent the wall on the opposite side
of the room the frame of a looking-glass was blackened and the
gilding must have been volatilized for a smelling-bottle which stood
on the chimney-piece was coated with bright metallic particles which
adhered as firmly as if they had been enamelled

 in south america i collected altogether twenty-seven species of
mice and thirteen more are known from the works of azara and other
authors those collected by myself have been named and described by

 in the stomach and duodenum of a capybara which i opened i found a
very large quantity of a thin yellowish fluid in which scarcely a
fibre could be distinguished mr owen informs me that a part of the
oesophagus is so constructed that nothing much larger than a crowquill
can be passed down certainly the broad teeth and strong jaws of this
animal are well fitted to grind into pulp the aquatic plants on which
it feeds 

 at the r negro in northern patagonia there is an animal of the
same habits and probably a closely allied species but which i never
saw its noise is different from that of the maldonado kind it is
repeated only twice instead of three or four times and is more
distinct and sonorous when heard from a distance it so closely
resembles the sound made in cutting down a small tree with an axe that
i have sometimes remained in doubt concerning it

july th the beagle sailed from maldonado and on august the
rd she arrived off the mouth of the rio negro this is the principal
river on the whole line of coast between the strait of magellan and the
plata it enters the sea about three hundred miles south of the
estuary of the plata about fifty years ago under the old spanish
government a small colony was established here and it is still the
most southern position lat degs on this eastern coast of america
inhabited by civilized man 

the country near the mouth of the river is wretched in the extreme on
the south side a long line of perpendicular cliffs commences which
exposes a section of the geological nature of the country the strata
are of sandstone and one layer was remarkable from being composed of a
firmly-cemented conglomerate of pumice pebbles which must have
travelled more than four hundred miles from the andes the surface is
everywhere covered up by a thick bed of gravel which extends far and
wide over the open plain water is extremely scarce and where found 
is almost invariably brackish the vegetation is scanty and although
there are bushes of many kinds all are armed with formidable thorns 
which seem to warn the stranger not to enter on these inhospitable
regions 

the settlement is situated eighteen miles up the river the road
follows the foot of the sloping cliff which forms the northern
boundary of the great valley in which the rio negro flows on the way
we passed the ruins of some fine estancias which a few years since
had been destroyed by the indians they withstood several attacks a
man present at one gave me a very lively description of what took
place the inhabitants had sufficient notice to drive all the cattle
and horses into the corral which surrounded the house and
likewise to mount some small cannon the indians were araucanians from
the south of chile several hundreds in number and highly disciplined 
they first appeared in two bodies on a neighbouring hill having there
dismounted and taken off their fur mantles they advanced naked to the
charge the only weapon of an indian is a very long bamboo or chuzo 
ornamented with ostrich feathers and pointed by a sharp spearhead my
informer seemed to remember with the greatest horror the quivering of
these chuzos as they approached near when close the cacique
pincheira hailed the besieged to give up their arms or he would cut
all their throats as this would probably have been the result of
their entrance under any circumstances the answer was given by a
volley of musketry the indians with great steadiness came to the
very fence of the corral but to their surprise they found the posts
fastened together by iron nails instead of leather thongs and of
course in vain attempted to cut them with their knives this saved
the lives of the christians many of the wounded indians were carried
away by their companions and at last one of the under caciques being
wounded the bugle sounded a retreat they retired to their horses 
and seemed to hold a council of war this was an awful pause for the
spaniards as all their ammunition with the exception of a few
cartridges was expended in an instant the indians mounted their
horses and galloped out of sight another attack was still more
quickly repulsed a cool frenchman managed the gun he stopped till the
indians approached close and then raked their line with grape-shot he
thus laid thirty-nine of them on the ground and of course such a
blow immediately routed the whole party 

the town is indifferently called el carmen or patagones it is built on
the face of a cliff which fronts the river and many of the houses are
excavated even in the sandstone the river is about two or three
hundred yards wide and is deep and rapid the many islands with
their willow-trees and the flat headlands seen one behind the other
on the northern boundary of the broad green valley form by the aid of
a bright sun a view almost picturesque the number of inhabitants
does not exceed a few hundreds these spanish colonies do not like
our british ones carry within themselves the elements of growth many
indians of pure blood reside here the tribe of the cacique lucanee
constantly have their toldos on the outskirts of the town the
local government partly supplies them with provisions by giving them
all the old worn-out horses and they earn a little by making
horse-rugs and other articles of riding-gear these indians are
considered civilized but what their character may have gained by a
lesser degree of ferocity is almost counterbalanced by their entire
immorality some of the younger men are however improving they are
willing to labour and a short time since a party went on a
sealing-voyage and behaved very well they were now enjoying the
fruits of their labour by being dressed in very gay clean clothes 
and by being very idle the taste they showed in their dress was
admirable if you could have turned one of these young indians into a
statue of bronze his drapery would have been perfectly graceful 

one day i rode to a large salt-lake or salina which is distant
fifteen miles from the town during the winter it consists of a
shallow lake of brine which in summer is converted into a field of
snow-white salt the layer near the margin is from four to five inches
thick but towards the centre its thickness increases this lake was
two and a half miles long and one broad others occur in the
neighbourhood many times larger and with a floor of salt two and
three feet in thickness even when under water during the winter one
of these brilliantly white and level expanses in the midst of the brown
and desolate plain offers an extraordinary spectacle a large
quantity of salt is annually drawn from the salina and great piles 
some hundred tons in weight were lying ready for exportation the
season for working the salinas forms the harvest of patagones for on
it the prosperity of the place depends nearly the whole population
encamps on the bank of the river and the people are employed in
drawing out the salt in bullock-waggons this salt is crystallized in
great cubes and is remarkably pure mr trenham reeks has kindly
analyzed some for me and he finds in it only of gypsum and 
of earthy matter it is a singular fact that it does not serve so
well for preserving meat as sea-salt from the cape de verd islands and
a merchant at buenos ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per
cent less valuable hence the cape de verd salt is constantly
imported and is mixed with that from these salinas the purity of the
patagonian salt or absence from it of those other saline bodies found
in all sea-water is the only assignable cause for this inferiority a
conclusion which no one i think would have suspected but which is
supported by the fact lately ascertained that those salts answer
best for preserving cheese which contain most of the deliquescent
chlorides 

the border of this lake is formed of mud and in this numerous large
crystals of gypsum some of which are three inches long lie embedded 
whilst on the surface others of sulphate of soda lie scattered about 
the gauchos call the former the padre del sal and the latter the
 madre they state that these progenitive salts always occur on the
borders of the salinas when the water begins to evaporate the mud is
black and has a fetid odour i could not at first imagine the cause
of this but i afterwards perceived that the froth which the wind
drifted on shore was coloured green as if by confervae i attempted to
carry home some of this green matter but from an accident failed 
parts of the lake seen from a short distance appeared of a reddish
colour and this perhaps was owing to some infusorial animalcula the
mud in many places was thrown up by numbers of some kind of worm or
annelidous animal how surprising it is that any creatures should be
able to exist in brine and that they should be crawling among crystals
of sulphate of soda and lime and what becomes of these worms when 
during the long summer the surface is hardened into a solid layer of
salt flamingoes in considerable numbers inhabit this lake and breed
here throughout patagonia in northern chile and at the galapagos
islands i met with these birds wherever there were lakes of brine i
saw them here wading about in search of food probably for the worms
which burrow in the mud and these latter probably feed on infusoria or
confervae thus we have a little living world within itself adapted to
these inland lakes of brine a minute crustaceous animal cancer
salinus is said to live in countless numbers in the brine-pans at
lymington but only in those in which the fluid has attained from
evaporation considerable strength namely about a quarter of a pound
of salt to a pint of water well may we affirm that every part of the
world is habitable whether lakes of brine or those subterranean ones
hidden beneath volcanic mountains warm mineral springs the wide
expanse and depths of the ocean the upper regions of the atmosphere 
and even the surface of perpetual snow all support organic beings 


to the northward of the rio negro between it and the inhabited country
near buenos ayres the spaniards have only one small settlement 
recently established at bahia blanca the distance in a straight line
to buenos ayres is very nearly five hundred british miles the
wandering tribes of horse indians which have always occupied the
greater part of this country having of late much harassed the outlying
estancias the government at buenos ayres equipped some time since an
army under the command of general rosas for the purpose of
exterminating them the troops were now encamped on the banks of the
colorado a river lying about eighty miles northward of the rio negro 
when general rosas left buenos ayres he struck in a direct line across
the unexplored plains and as the country was thus pretty well cleared
of indians he left behind him at wide intervals a small party of
soldiers with a troop of horses a posta so as to be enabled to keep
up a communication with the capital as the beagle intended to call at
bahia blanca i determined to proceed there by land and ultimately i
extended my plan to travel the whole way by the postas to buenos ayres 

august th mr harris an englishman residing at patagones a guide 
and five gauchos who were proceeding to the army on business were my
companions on the journey the colorado as i have already said is
nearly eighty miles distant and as we travelled slowly we were two
days and a half on the road the whole line of country deserves
scarcely a better name than that of a desert water is found only in
two small wells it is called fresh but even at this time of the year 
during the rainy season it was quite brackish in the summer this must
be a distressing passage for now it was sufficiently desolate the
valley of the rio negro broad as it is has merely been excavated out
of the sandstone plain for immediately above the bank on which the
town stands a level country commences which is interrupted only by a
few trifling valleys and depressions everywhere the landscape wears
the same sterile aspect a dry gravelly soil supports tufts of brown
withered grass and low scattered bushes armed with thorns 

shortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous
tree which the indians reverence as the altar of walleechu it is
situated on a high part of the plain and hence is a landmark visible
at a great distance as soon as a tribe of indians come in sight of
it they offer their adorations by loud shouts the tree itself is
low much branched and thorny just above the root it has a diameter
of about three feet it stands by itself without any neighbour and
was indeed the first tree we saw afterwards we met with a few others
of the same kind but they were far from common being winter the tree
had no leaves but in their place numberless threads by which the
various offerings such as cigars bread meat pieces of cloth etc 
had been suspended poor indians not having anything better only pull
a thread out of their ponchos and fasten it to the tree richer
indians are accustomed to pour spirits and mate into a certain hole 
and likewise to smoke upwards thinking thus to afford all possible
gratification to walleechu to complete the scene the tree was
surrounded by the bleached bones of horses which had been slaughtered
as sacrifices all indians of every age and sex make their offerings 
they then think that their horses will not tire and that they
themselves shall be prosperous the gaucho who told me this said that
in the time of peace he had witnessed this scene and that he and
others used to wait till the indians had passed by for the sake of
stealing from walleechu the offerings 

the gauchos think that the indians consider the tree as the god itself 
but it seems for more probable that they regard it as the altar the
only cause which i can imagine for this choice is its being a landmark
in a dangerous passage the sierra de la ventana is visible at an
immense distance and a gaucho told me that he was once riding with an
indian a few miles to the north of the rio colorado when the indian
commenced making the same loud noise which is usual at the first sight
of the distant tree putting his hand to his head and then pointing in
the direction of the sierra upon being asked the reason of this the
indian said in broken spanish first see the sierra about two
leagues beyond this curious tree we halted for the night at this
instant an unfortunate cow was spied by the lynx-eyed gauchos who set
off in full chase and in a few minutes dragged her in with their
lazos and slaughtered her we here had the four necessaries of life
 en el campo pasture for the horses water only a muddy puddle 
meat and firewood the gauchos were in high spirits at finding all
these luxuries and we soon set to work at the poor cow this was the
first night which i passed under the open sky with the gear of the
recado for my bed there is high enjoyment in the independence of the
gaucho life to be able at any moment to pull up your horse and say 
 here we will pass the night the death-like stillness of the plain 
the dogs keeping watch the gipsy-group of gauchos making their beds
round the fire have left in my mind a strongly-marked picture of this
first night which will never be forgotten 

the next day the country continued similar to that above described it
is inhabited by few birds or animals of any kind occasionally a deer 
or a guanaco wild llama may be seen but the agouti cavia
patagonica is the commonest quadruped this animal here represents
our hares it differs however from that genus in many essential
respects for instance it has only three toes behind it is also
nearly twice the size weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds the
agouti is a true friend of the desert it is a common feature of the
landscape to see two or three hopping quickly one after the other in a
straight line across these wild plains they are found as far north as
the sierra tapalguen lat degs where the plain rather
suddenly becomes greener and more humid and their southern limit is
between port desire and st julian where there is no change in the
nature of the country it is a singular fact that although the agouti
is not now found as far south as port st julian yet that captain
wood in his voyage in talks of them as being numerous there 
what cause can have altered in a wide uninhabited and rarely-visited
country the range of an animal like this it appears also from the
number shot by captain wood in one day at port desire that they must
have been considerably more abundant there formerly than at present 
where the bizcacha lives and makes its burrows the agouti uses them 
but where as at bahia blanca the bizcacha is not found the agouti
burrows for itself the same thing occurs with the little owl of the
pampas athene cunicularia which has so often been described as
standing like a sentinel at the mouth of the burrows for in banda
oriental owing to the absence of the bizcacha it is obliged to hollow
out its own habitation 

the next morning as we approached the rio colorado the appearance of
the country changed we soon came on a plain covered with turf which 
from its flowers tall clover and little owls resembled the pampas 
we passed also a muddy swamp of considerable extent which in summer
dries and becomes incrusted with various salts and hence is called a
salitral it was covered by low succulent plants of the same kind
with those growing on the sea-shore the colorado at the pass where
we crossed it is only about sixty yards wide generally it must be
nearly double that width its course is very tortuous being marked by
willow-trees and beds of reeds in a direct line the distance to the
mouth of the river is said to be nine leagues but by water
twenty-five we were delayed crossing in the canoe by some immense
troops of mares which were swimming the river in order to follow a
division of troops into the interior a more ludicrous spectacle i
never beheld than the hundreds and hundreds of heads all directed one
way with pointed ears and distended snorting nostrils appearing just
above the water like a great shoal of some amphibious animal mare s
flesh is the only food which the soldiers have when on an expedition 
this gives them a great facility of movement for the distance to which
horses can be driven over these plains is quite surprising i have been
assured that an unloaded horse can travel a hundred miles a day for
many days successively 

the encampment of general rosas was close to the river it consisted of
a square formed by waggons artillery straw huts etc the soldiers
were nearly all cavalry and i should think such a villainous 
banditti-like army was never before collected together the greater
number of men were of a mixed breed between negro indian and
spaniard i know not the reason but men of such origin seldom have a
good expression of countenance i called on the secretary to show my
passport he began to cross-question me in the most dignified and
mysterious manner by good luck i had a letter of recommendation from
the government of buenos ayres to the commandant of patagones this
was taken to general rosas who sent me a very obliging message and
the secretary returned all smiles and graciousness we took up our
residence in the rancho or hovel of a curious old spaniard who had
served with napoleon in the expedition against russia 

we stayed two days at the colorado i had little to do for the
surrounding country was a swamp which in summer december when the
snow melts on the cordillera is over-flowed by the river my chief
amusement was watching the indian families as they came to buy little
articles at the rancho where we stayed it was supposed that general
rosas had about six hundred indian allies the men were a tall fine
race yet it was afterwards easy to see in the fuegian savage the same
countenance rendered hideous by cold want of food and less
civilization some authors in defining the primary races of mankind 
have separated these indians into two classes but this is certainly
incorrect among the young women or chinas some deserve to be called
even beautiful their hair was coarse but bright and black and they
wore it in two plaits hanging down to the waist they had a high
colour and eyes that glistened with brilliancy their legs feet and
arms were small and elegantly formed their ankles and sometimes their
wrists were ornamented by broad bracelets of blue beads nothing
could be more interesting than some of the family groups a mother
with one or two daughters would often come to our rancho mounted on
the same horse they ride like men but with their knees tucked up
much higher this habit perhaps arises from their being accustomed 
when travelling to ride the loaded horses the duty of the women is
to load and unload the horses to make the tents for the night in
short to be like the wives of all savages useful slaves the men
fight hunt take care of the horses and make the riding gear one of
their chief indoor occupations is to knock two stones together till
they become round in order to make the bolas with this important
weapon the indian catches his game and also his horse which roams
free over the plain in fighting his first attempt is to throw down
the horse of his adversary with the bolas and when entangled by the
fall to kill him with the chuzo if the balls only catch the neck or
body of an animal they are often carried away and lost as the making
the stones round is the labour of two days the manufacture of the
balls is a very common employment several of the men and women had
their faces painted red but i never saw the horizontal bands which are
so common among the fuegians their chief pride consists in having
everything made of silver i have seen a cacique with his spurs 
stirrups handle of his knife and bridle made of this metal the
head-stall and reins being of wire were not thicker than whipcord and
to see a fiery steed wheeling about under the command of so light a
chain gave to the horsemanship a remarkable character of elegance 

general rosas intimated a wish to see me a circumstance which i was
afterwards very glad of he is a man of an extraordinary character 
and has a most predominant influence in the country which it seems he
will use to its prosperity and advancement he is said to be the
owner of seventy-four square leagues of land and to have about three
hundred thousand head of cattle his estates are admirably managed 
and are far more productive of corn than those of others he first
gained his celebrity by his laws for his own estancias and by
disciplining several hundred men so as to resist with success the
attacks of the indians there are many stories current about the rigid
manner in which his laws were enforced one of these was that no man 
on penalty of being put into the stocks should carry his knife on a
sunday this being the principal day for gambling and drinking many
quarrels arose which from the general manner of fighting with the
knife often proved fatal one sunday the governor came in great form
to pay the estancia a visit and general rosas in his hurry walked
out to receive him with his knife as usual stuck in his belt the
steward touched his arm and reminded him of the law upon which
turning to the governor he said he was extremely sorry but that he
must go into the stocks and that till let out he possessed no power
even in his own house after a little time the steward was persuaded
to open the stocks and to let him out but no sooner was this done 
than he turned to the steward and said you now have broken the laws 
so you must take my place in the stocks such actions as these
delighted the gauchos who all possess high notions of their own
equality and dignity 

general rosas is also a perfect horseman an accomplishment of no small
consequence in a country where an assembled army elected its general by
the following trial a troop of unbroken horses being driven into a
corral were let out through a gateway above which was a cross-bar it
was agreed whoever should drop from the bar on one of these wild
animals as it rushed out and should be able without saddle or
bridle not only to ride it but also to bring it back to the door of
the corral should be their general the person who succeeded was
accordingly elected and doubtless made a fit general for such an army 
this extraordinary feat has also been performed by rosas 

by these means and by conforming to the dress and habits of the
gauchos he has obtained an unbounded popularity in the country and in
consequence a despotic power i was assured by an english merchant 
that a man who had murdered another when arrested and questioned
concerning his motive answered he spoke disrespectfully of general
rosas so i killed him at the end of a week the murderer was at
liberty this doubtless was the act of the general s party and not of
the general himself 

in conversation he is enthusiastic sensible and very grave his
gravity is carried to a high pitch i heard one of his mad buffoons
 for he keeps two like the barons of old relate the following
anecdote i wanted very much to hear a certain piece of music so i
went to the general two or three times to ask him he said to me go
about your business for i am engaged i went a second time he said 
 if you come again i will punish you a third time i asked and he
laughed i rushed out of the tent but it was too late he ordered two
soldiers to catch and stake me i begged by all the saints in heaven
he would let me off but it would not do when the general laughs he
spares neither mad man nor sound the poor flighty gentleman looked
quite dolorous at the very recollection of the staking this is a
very severe punishment four posts are driven into the ground and the
man is extended by his arms and legs horizontally and there left to
stretch for several hours the idea is evidently taken from the usual
method of drying hides my interview passed away without a smile and
i obtained a passport and order for the government post-horses and
this he gave me in the most obliging and ready manner 

in the morning we started for bahia blanca which we reached in two
days leaving the regular encampment we passed by the toldos of the
indians these are round like ovens and covered with hides by the
mouth of each a tapering chuzo was stuck in the ground the toldos
were divided into separate groups which belong to the different
caciques tribes and the groups were again divided into smaller ones 
according to the relationship of the owners for several miles we
travelled along the valley of the colorado the alluvial plains on the
side appeared fertile and it is supposed that they are well adapted to
the growth of corn turning northward from the river we soon entered
on a country differing from the plains south of the river the land
still continued dry and sterile but it supported many different kinds
of plants and the grass though brown and withered was more abundant 
as the thorny bushes were less so these latter in a short space
entirely disappeared and the plains were left without a thicket to
cover their nakedness this change in the vegetation marks the
commencement of the grand calcareo argillaceous deposit which forms
the wide extent of the pampas and covers the granitic rocks of banda
oriental from the strait of magellan to the colorado a distance of
about eight hundred miles the face of the country is everywhere
composed of shingle the pebbles are chiefly of porphyry and probably
owe their origin to the rocks of the cordillera north of the colorado
this bed thins out and the pebbles become exceedingly small and here
the characteristic vegetation of patagonia ceases 

having ridden about twenty-five miles we came to a broad belt of
sand-dunes which stretches as far as the eye can reach to the east
and west the sand-hillocks resting on the clay allow small pools of
water to collect and thus afford in this dry country an invaluable
supply of fresh water the great advantage arising from depressions
and elevations of the soil is not often brought home to the mind the
two miserable springs in the long passage between the rio negro and
colorado were caused by trifling inequalities in the plain without
them not a drop of water would have been found the belt of sand-dunes
is about eight miles wide at some former period it probably formed
the margin of a grand estuary where the colorado now flows in this
district where absolute proofs of the recent elevation of the land
occur such speculations can hardly be neglected by any one although
merely considering the physical geography of the country having
crossed the sandy tract we arrived in the evening at one of the
post-houses and as the fresh horses were grazing at a distance we
determined to pass the night there 

the house was situated at the base of a ridge between one and two
hundred feet high a most remarkable feature in this country this
posta was commanded by a negro lieutenant born in africa to his
credit be it said there was not a ranche between the colorado and
buenos ayres in nearly such neat order as his he had a little room
for strangers and a small corral for the horses all made of sticks
and reeds he had also dug a ditch round his house as a defence in case
of being attacked this would however have been of little avail if
the indians had come but his chief comfort seemed to rest in the
thought of selling his life dearly a short time before a body of
indians had travelled past in the night if they had been aware of the
posta our black friend and his four soldiers would assuredly have been
slaughtered i did not anywhere meet a more civil and obliging man
than this negro it was therefore the more painful to see that he would
not sit down and eat with us 

in the morning we sent for the horses very early and started for
another exhilarating gallop we passed the cabeza del buey an old
name given to the head of a large marsh which extends from bahia
blanca here we changed horses and passed through some leagues of
swamps and saline marshes changing horses for the last time we again
began wading through the mud my animal fell and i was well soused in
black mire a very disagreeable accident when one does not possess a
change of clothes some miles from the fort we met a man who told us
that a great gun had been fired which is a signal that indians are
near we immediately left the road and followed the edge of a marsh 
which when chased offers the best mode of escape we were glad to
arrive within the walls when we found all the alarm was about nothing 
for the indians turned out to be friendly ones who wished to join
general rosas 

bahia blanca scarcely deserves the name of a village a few houses and
the barracks for the troops are enclosed by a deep ditch and fortified
wall the settlement is only of recent standing since and its
growth has been one of trouble the government of buenos ayres
unjustly occupied it by force instead of following the wise example of
the spanish viceroys who purchased the land near the older settlement
of the rio negro from the indians hence the need of the
fortifications hence the few houses and little cultivated land without
the limits of the walls even the cattle are not safe from the attacks
of the indians beyond the boundaries of the plain on which the
fortress stands 

the part of the harbour where the beagle intended to anchor being
distant twenty-five miles i obtained from the commandant a guide and
horses to take me to see whether she had arrived leaving the plain
of green turf which extended along the course of a little brook we
soon entered on a wide level waste consisting either of sand saline
marshes or bare mud some parts were clothed by low thickets and
others with those succulent plants which luxuriate only where salt
abounds bad as the country was ostriches deer agoutis and
armadilloes were abundant my guide told me that two months before
he had a most narrow escape of his life he was out hunting with two
other men at no great distance from this part of the country when
they were suddenly met by a party of indians who giving chase soon
overtook and killed his two friends his own horse s legs were also
caught by the bolas but he jumped off and with his knife cut them
free while doing this he was obliged to dodge round his horse and
received two severe wounds from their chuzos springing on the saddle 
he managed by a most wonderful exertion just to keep ahead of the
long spears of his pursuers who followed him to within sight of the
fort from that time there was an order that no one should stray far
from the settlement i did not know of this when i started and was
surprised to observe how earnestly my guide watched a deer which
appeared to have been frightened from a distant quarter 

we found the beagle had not arrived and consequently set out on our
return but the horses soon tiring we were obliged to bivouac on the
plain in the morning we had caught an armadillo which although a
most excellent dish when roasted in its shell did not make a very
substantial breakfast and dinner for two hungry men the ground at the
place where we stopped for the night was incrusted with a layer of
sulphate of soda and hence of course was without water yet many of
the smaller rodents managed to exist even here and the tucutuco was
making its odd little grunt beneath my head during half the night our
horses were very poor ones and in the morning they were soon exhausted
from not having had anything to drink so that we were obliged to walk 
about noon the dogs killed a kid which we roasted i ate some of it 
but it made me intolerably thirsty this was the more distressing as
the road from some recent rain was full of little puddles of clear
water yet not a drop was drinkable i had scarcely been twenty hours
without water and only part of the time under a hot sun yet the
thirst rendered me very weak how people survive two or three days
under such circumstances i cannot imagine at the same time i must
confess that my guide did not suffer at all and was astonished that
one day s deprivation should be so troublesome to me 

i have several times alluded to the surface of the ground being
incrusted with salt this phenomenon is quite different from that of
the salinas and more extraordinary in many parts of south america 
wherever the climate is moderately dry these incrustations occur but
i have nowhere seen them so abundant as near bahia blanca the salt
here and in other parts of patagonia consists chiefly of sulphate of
soda with some common salt as long as the ground remains moist in the
salitrales as the spaniards improperly call them mistaking this
substance for saltpeter nothing is to be seen but an extensive plain
composed of a black muddy soil supporting scattered tufts of
succulent plants on returning through one of these tracts after a
week s hot weather one is surprised to see square miles of the plain
white as if from a slight fall of snow here and there heaped up by
the wind into little drifts this latter appearance is chiefly caused
by the salts being drawn up during the slow evaporation of the
moisture round blades of dead grass stumps of wood and pieces of
broken earth instead of being crystallized at the bottoms of the
puddles of water the salitrales occur either on level tracts elevated
only a few feet above the level of the sea or on alluvial land
bordering rivers m parchappe found that the saline incrustation
on the plain at the distance of some miles from the sea consisted
chiefly of sulphate of soda with only seven per cent of common salt 
whilst nearer to the coast the common salt increased to parts in a
hundred this circumstance would tempt one to believe that the
sulphate of soda is generated in the soil from the muriate left on
the surface during the slow and recent elevation of this dry country 
the whole phenomenon is well worthy the attention of naturalists have
the succulent salt-loving plants which are well known to contain much
soda the power of decomposing the muriate does the black fetid mud 
abounding with organic matter yield the sulphur and ultimately the
sulphuric acid 

two days afterwards i again rode to the harbour when not far from our
destination my companion the same man as before spied three people
hunting on horseback he immediately dismounted and watching them
intently said they don t ride like christians and nobody can leave
the fort the three hunters joined company and likewise dismounted
from their horses at last one mounted again and rode over the hill
out of sight my companion said we must now get on our horses load
your pistol and he looked to his own sword i asked are they
indians quien sabe who knows if there are no more than three 
it does not signify it then struck me that the one man had gone over
the hill to fetch the rest of his tribe i suggested this but all the
answer i could extort was quien sabe his head and eye never for a
minute ceased scanning slowly the distant horizon i thought his
uncommon coolness too good a joke and asked him why he did not return
home i was startled when he answered we are returning but in a
line so as to pass near a swamp into which we can gallop the horses as
far as they can go and then trust to our own legs so that there is no
danger i did not feel quite so confident of this and wanted to
increase our pace he said no not until they do when any little
inequality concealed us we galloped but when in sight continued
walking at last we reached a valley and turning to the left 
galloped quickly to the foot of a hill he gave me his horse to hold 
made the dogs lie down and then crawled on his hands and knees to
reconnoitre he remained in this position for some time and at last 
bursting out in laughter exclaimed mugeres women he knew them
to be the wife and sister-in-law of the major s son hunting for
ostrich s eggs i have described this man s conduct because he acted
under the full impression that they were indians as soon however as
the absurd mistake was found out he gave me a hundred reasons why they
could not have been indians but all these were forgotten at the time 
we then rode on in peace and quietness to a low point called punta
alta whence we could see nearly the whole of the great harbour of
bahia blanca 

the wide expanse of water is choked up by numerous great mud-banks 
which the inhabitants call cangrejales or crabberies from the
number of small crabs the mud is so soft that it is impossible to
walk over them even for the shortest distance many of the banks have
their surfaces covered with long rushes the tops of which alone are
visible at high water on one occasion when in a boat we were so
entangled by these shallows that we could hardly find our way nothing
was visible but the flat beds of mud the day was not very clear and
there was much refraction or as the sailors expressed it things
loomed high the only object within our view which was not level was
the horizon rushes looked like bushes unsupported in the air and
water like mud-banks and mud-banks like water 

we passed the night in punta alta and i employed myself in searching
for fossil bones this point being a perfect catacomb for monsters of
extinct races the evening was perfectly calm and clear the extreme
monotony of the view gave it an interest even in the midst of mud-banks
and gulls sand-hillocks and solitary vultures in riding back in the
morning we came across a very fresh track of a puma but did not
succeed in finding it we saw also a couple of zorillos or
skunks odious animals which are far from uncommon in general
appearance the zorillo resembles a polecat but it is rather larger 
and much thicker in proportion conscious of its power it roams by day
about the open plain and fears neither dog nor man if a dog is urged
to the attack its courage is instantly checked by a few drops of the
fetid oil which brings on violent sickness and running at the nose 
whatever is once polluted by it is for ever useless azara says the
smell can be perceived at a league distant more than once when
entering the harbour of monte video the wind being off shore we have
perceived the odour on board the beagle certain it is that every
animal most willingly makes room for the zorillo

the beagle arrived here on the th of august and a week afterwards
sailed for the plata with captain fitz roy s consent i was left
behind to travel by land to buenos ayres i will here add some
observations which were made during this visit and on a previous
occasion when the beagle was employed in surveying the harbour 

the plain at the distance of a few miles from the coast belongs to
the great pampean formation which consists in part of a reddish clay 
and in part of a highly calcareous marly rock nearer the coast there
are some plains formed from the wreck of the upper plain and from mud 
gravel and sand thrown up by the sea during the slow elevation of the
land of which elevation we have evidence in upraised beds of recent
shells and in rounded pebbles of pumice scattered over the country at
punta alta we have a section of one of these later-formed little
plains which is highly interesting from the number and extraordinary
character of the remains of gigantic land-animals embedded in it these
have been fully described by professor owen in the zoology of the
voyage of the beagle and are deposited in the college of surgeons i
will here give only a brief outline of their nature 

first parts of three heads and other bones of the megatherium the
huge dimensions of which are expressed by its name secondly the
megalonyx a great allied animal thirdly the scelidotherium also an
allied animal of which i obtained a nearly perfect skeleton it must
have been as large as a rhinoceros in the structure of its head it
comes according to mr owen nearest to the cape anteater but in some
other respects it approaches to the armadilloes fourthly the mylodon
darwinii a closely related genus of little inferior size fifthly 
another gigantic edental quadruped sixthly a large animal with an
osseous coat in compartments very like that of an armadillo 
seventhly an extinct kind of horse to which i shall have again to
refer eighthly a tooth of a pachydermatous animal probably the same
with the macrauchenia a huge beast with a long neck like a camel 
which i shall also refer to again lastly the toxodon perhaps one of
the strangest animals ever discovered in size it equalled an elephant
or megatherium but the structure of its teeth as mr owen states 
proves indisputably that it was intimately related to the gnawers the
order which at the present day includes most of the smallest
quadrupeds in many details it is allied to the pachydermata judging
from the position of its eyes ears and nostrils it was probably
aquatic like the dugong and manatee to which it is also allied how
wonderfully are the different orders at the present time so well
separated blended together in different points of the structure of the
toxodon 

the remains of these nine great quadrupeds and many detached bones 
were found embedded on the beach within the space of about yards
square it is a remarkable circumstance that so many different species
should be found together and it proves how numerous in kind the
ancient inhabitants of this country must have been at the distance of
about thirty miles from punta alta in a cliff of red earth i found
several fragments of bones some of large size among them were the
teeth of a gnawer equalling in size and closely resembling those of
the capybara whose habits have been described and therefore 
probably an aquatic animal there was also part of the head of a
ctenomys the species being different from the tucutuco but with a
close general resemblance the red earth like that of the pampas in
which these remains were embedded contains according to professor
ehrenberg eight fresh-water and one salt-water infusorial animalcule 
therefore probably it was an estuary deposit 

the remains at punta alta were embedded in stratified gravel and
reddish mud just such as the sea might now wash up on a shallow bank 
they were associated with twenty-three species of shells of which
thirteen are recent and four others very closely related to recent
forms from the bones of the scelidotherium including even the
knee-cap being intombed in their proper relative positions and from
the osseous armour of the great armadillo-like animal being so well
preserved together with the bones of one of its legs we may feel
assured that these remains were fresh and united by their ligaments 
when deposited in the gravel together with the shells hence we
have good evidence that the above enumerated gigantic quadrupeds more
different from those of the present day than the oldest of the tertiary
quadrupeds of europe lived whilst the sea was peopled with most of its
present inhabitants and we have confirmed that remarkable law so often
insisted on by mr lyell namely that the longevity of the species in
the mammalia is upon the whole inferior to that of the testacea 

the great size of the bones of the megatheroid animals including the
megatherium megalonyx scelidotherium and mylodon is truly
wonderful the habits of life of these animals were a complete puzzle
to naturalists until professor owen solved the problem with
remarkable ingenuity the teeth indicate by their simple structure 
that these megatheroid animals lived on vegetable food and probably on
the leaves and small twigs of trees their ponderous forms and great
strong curved claws seem so little adapted for locomotion that some
eminent naturalists have actually believed that like the sloths to
which they are intimately related they subsisted by climbing back
downwards on trees and feeding on the leaves it was a bold not to
say preposterous idea to conceive even antediluvian trees with
branches strong enough to bear animals as large as elephants professor
owen with far more probability believes that instead of climbing on
the trees they pulled the branches down to them and tore up the
smaller ones by the roots and so fed on the leaves the colossal
breadth and weight of their hinder quarters which can hardly be
imagined without having been seen become on this view of obvious
service instead of being an incumbrance their apparent clumsiness
disappears with their great tails and their huge heels firmly fixed
like a tripod on the ground they could freely exert the full force of
their most powerful arms and great claws strongly rooted indeed 
must that tree have been which could have resisted such force the
mylodon moreover was furnished with a long extensile tongue like that
of the giraffe which by one of those beautiful provisions of nature 
thus reaches with the aid of its long neck its leafy food i may
remark that in abyssinia the elephant according to bruce when it
cannot reach with its proboscis the branches deeply scores with its
tusks the trunk of the tree up and down and all round till it is
sufficiently weakened to be broken down 

the beds including the above fossil remains stand only from fifteen to
twenty feet above the level of high-water and hence the elevation of
the land has been small without there has been an intercalated period
of subsidence of which we have no evidence since the great quadrupeds
wandered over the surrounding plains and the external features of the
country must then have been very nearly the same as now what it may
naturally be asked was the character of the vegetation at that period 
was the country as wretchedly sterile as it now is as so many of the
co-embedded shells are the same with those now living in the bay i was
at first inclined to think that the former vegetation was probably
similar to the existing one but this would have been an erroneous
inference for some of these same shells live on the luxuriant coast of
brazil and generally the character of the inhabitants of the sea are
useless as guides to judge of those on the land nevertheless from
the following considerations i do not believe that the simple fact of
many gigantic quadrupeds having lived on the plains round bahia blanca 
is any sure guide that they formerly were clothed with a luxuriant
vegetation i have no doubt that the sterile country a little
southward near the rio negro with its scattered thorny trees would
support many and large quadrupeds 


that large animals require a luxuriant vegetation has been a general
assumption which has passed from one work to another but i do not
hesitate to say that it is completely false and that it has vitiated
the reasoning of geologists on some points of great interest in the
ancient history of the world the prejudice has probably been derived
from india and the indian islands where troops of elephants noble
forests and impenetrable jungles are associated together in every
one s mind if however we refer to any work of travels through the
southern parts of africa we shall find allusions in almost every page
either to the desert character of the country or to the numbers of
large animals inhabiting it the same thing is rendered evident by the
many engravings which have been published of various parts of the
interior when the beagle was at cape town i made an excursion of
some days length into the country which at least was sufficient to
render that which i had read more fully intelligible 

dr andrew smith who at the head of his adventurous party has lately
succeeded in passing the tropic of capricorn informs me that taking
into consideration the whole of the southern part of africa there can
be no doubt of its being a sterile country on the southern and
south-eastern coasts there are some fine forests but with these
exceptions the traveller may pass for days together through open
plains covered by a poor and scanty vegetation it is difficult to
convey any accurate idea of degrees of comparative fertility but it
may be safely said that the amount of vegetation supported at any one
time by great britain exceeds perhaps even tenfold the quantity
on an equal area in the interior parts of southern africa the fact
that bullock-waggons can travel in any direction excepting near the
coast without more than occasionally half an hour s delay in cutting
down bushes gives perhaps a more definite notion of the scantiness
of the vegetation now if we look to the animals inhabiting these
wide plains we shall find their numbers extraordinarily great and
their bulk immense we must enumerate the elephant three species of
rhinoceros and probably according to dr smith two others the
hippopotamus the giraffe the bos caffer as large as a full-grown
bull and the elan but little less two zebras and the quaccha two
gnus and several antelopes even larger than these latter animals it
may be supposed that although the species are numerous the individuals
of each kind are few by the kindness of dr smith i am enabled to
show that the case is very different he informs me that in lat 
degs in one day s march with the bullock-waggons he saw without
wandering to any great distance on either side between one hundred and
one hundred and fifty rhinoceroses which belonged to three species 
the same day he saw several herds of giraffes amounting together to
nearly a hundred and that although no elephant was observed yet they
are found in this district at the distance of a little more than one
hour s march from their place of encampment on the previous night his
party actually killed at one spot eight hippopotamuses and saw many
more in this same river there were likewise crocodiles of course it
was a case quite extraordinary to see so many great animals crowded
together but it evidently proves that they must exist in great
numbers dr smith describes the country passed through that day as
 being thinly covered with grass and bushes about four feet high and
still more thinly with mimosa-trees the waggons were not prevented
travelling in a nearly straight line 

besides these large animals every one the least acquainted with the
natural history of the cape has read of the herds of antelopes which
can be compared only with the flocks of migratory birds the numbers
indeed of the lion panther and hyaena and the multitude of birds of
prey plainly speak of the abundance of the smaller quadrupeds one
evening seven lions were counted at the same time prowling round dr 
smith s encampment as this able naturalist remarked to me the
carnage each day in southern africa must indeed be terrific i confess
it is truly surprising how such a number of animals can find support in
a country producing so little food the larger quadrupeds no doubt
roam over wide tracts in search of it and their food chiefly consists
of underwood which probably contains much nutriment in a small bulk 
dr smith also informs me that the vegetation has a rapid growth no
sooner is a part consumed than its place is supplied by a fresh stock 
there can be no doubt however that our ideas respecting the apparent
amount of food necessary for the support of large quadrupeds are much
exaggerated it should have been remembered that the camel an animal
of no mean bulk has always been considered as the emblem of the desert 

the belief that where large quadrupeds exist the vegetation must
necessarily be luxuriant is the more remarkable because the converse
is far from true mr burchell observed to me that when entering
brazil nothing struck him more forcibly than the splendour of the
south american vegetation contrasted with that of south africa 
together with the absence of all large quadrupeds in his travels 
he has suggested that the comparison of the respective weights if
there were sufficient data of an equal number of the largest
herbivorous quadrupeds of each country would be extremely curious if
we take on the one side the elephant hippopotamus giraffe bos
caffer elan certainly three and probably five species of rhinoceros 
and on the american side two tapirs the guanaco three deer the
vicuna peccari capybara after which we must choose from the monkeys
to complete the number and then place these two groups alongside each
other it is not easy to conceive ranks more disproportionate in size 
after the above facts we are compelled to conclude against anterior
probability that among the mammalia there exists no close relation
between the bulk of the species and the quantity of the vegetation 
in the countries which they inhabit 

with regard to the number of large quadrupeds there certainly exists
no quarter of the globe which will bear comparison with southern
africa after the different statements which have been given the
extremely desert character of that region will not be disputed in the
european division of the world we must look back to the tertiary
epochs to find a condition of things among the mammalia resembling
that now existing at the cape of good hope those tertiary epochs 
which we are apt to consider as abounding to an astonishing degree with
large animals because we find the remains of many ages accumulated at
certain spots could hardly boast of more large quadrupeds than
southern africa does at present if we speculate on the condition of
the vegetation during these epochs we are at least bound so far to
consider existing analogies as not to urge as absolutely necessary a
luxuriant vegetation when we see a state of things so totally
different at the cape of good hope 

we know that the extreme regions of north america many degrees
beyond the limit where the ground at the depth of a few feet remains
perpetually congealed are covered by forests of large and tall trees 
in a like manner in siberia we have woods of birch fir aspen and
larch growing in a latitude degs where the mean temperature
of the air falls below the freezing point and where the earth is so
completely frozen that the carcass of an animal embedded in it is
perfectly preserved with these facts we must grant as far as
 quantity alone of vegetation is concerned that the great quadrupeds
of the later tertiary epochs might in most parts of northern europe
and asia have lived on the spots where their remains are now found i
do not here speak of the kind of vegetation necessary for their
support because as there is evidence of physical changes and as the
animals have become extinct so may we suppose that the species of
plants have likewise been changed 

these remarks i may be permitted to add directly bear on the case of
the siberian animals preserved in ice the firm conviction of the
necessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical
luxuriance to support such large animals and the impossibility of
reconciling this with the proximity of perpetual congelation was one
chief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate 
and of overwhelming catastrophes which were invented to account for
their entombment i am far from supposing that the climate has not
changed since the period when those animals lived which now lie buried
in the ice at present i only wish to show that as far as quantity 
of food alone is concerned the ancient rhinoceroses might have
roamed over the steppes of central siberia the northern parts
probably being under water even in their present condition as well as
the living rhinoceroses and elephants over the karros of southern
africa 


i will now give an account of the habits of some of the more
interesting birds which are common on the wild plains of northern
patagonia and first for the largest or south american ostrich the
ordinary habits of the ostrich are familiar to every one they live on
vegetable matter such as roots and grass but at bahia blanca i have
repeatedly seen three or four come down at low water to the extensive
mud-banks which are then dry for the sake as the gauchos say of
feeding on small fish although the ostrich in its habits is so shy 
wary and solitary and although so fleet in its pace it is caught
without much difficulty by the indian or gaucho armed with the bolas 
when several horsemen appear in a semicircle it becomes confounded 
and does not know which way to escape they generally prefer running
against the wind yet at the first start they expand their wings and
like a vessel make all sail on one fine hot day i saw several
ostriches enter a bed of tall rushes where they squatted concealed 
till quite closely approached it is not generally known that ostriches
readily take to the water mr king informs me that at the bay of san
blas and at port valdes in patagonia he saw these birds swimming
several times from island to island they ran into the water both when
driven down to a point and likewise of their own accord when not
frightened the distance crossed was about two hundred yards when
swimming very little of their bodies appear above water their necks
are extended a little forward and their progress is slow on two
occasions i saw some ostriches swimming across the santa cruz river 
where its course was about four hundred yards wide and the stream
rapid captain sturt when descending the murrumbidgee in
australia saw two emus in the act of swimming 

the inhabitants of the country readily distinguish even at a distance 
the cock bird from the hen the former is larger and darker-coloured 
 and has a bigger head the ostrich i believe the cock emits a
singular deep-toned hissing note when first i heard it standing in
the midst of some sand-hillocks i thought it was made by some wild
beast for it is a sound that one cannot tell whence it comes or from
how far distant when we were at bahia blanca in the months of
september and october the eggs in extraordinary numbers were found
all over the country they lie either scattered and single in which
case they are never hatched and are called by the spaniards huachos 
or they are collected together into a shallow excavation which forms
the nest out of the four nests which i saw three contained
twenty-two eggs each and the fourth twenty-seven in one day s hunting
on horseback sixty-four eggs were found forty-four of these were in
two nests and the remaining twenty scattered huachos the gauchos
unanimously affirm and there is no reason to doubt their statement 
that the male bird alone hatches the eggs and for some time afterwards
accompanies the young the cock when on the nest lies very close i
have myself almost ridden over one it is asserted that at such times
they are occasionally fierce and even dangerous and that they have
been known to attack a man on horseback trying to kick and leap on
him my informer pointed out to me an old man whom he had seen much
terrified by one chasing him i observe in burchell s travels in south
africa that he remarks having killed a male ostrich and the
feathers being dirty it was said by the hottentots to be a nest bird 
i understand that the male emu in the zoological gardens takes charge
of the nest this habit therefore is common to the family 

the gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest i
have been positively told that four or five hen birds have been watched
to go in the middle of the day one after the other to the same nest 
i may add also that it is believed in africa that two or more
females lay in one nest although this habit at first appears very
strange i think the cause may be explained in a simple manner the
number of eggs in the nest varies from twenty to forty and even to
fifty and according to azara some times to seventy or eighty now 
although it is most probable from the number of eggs found in one
district being so extraordinarily great in proportion to the parent
birds and likewise from the state of the ovarium of the hen that she
may in the course of the season lay a large number yet the time
required must be very long azara states that a female in a
state of domestication laid seventeen eggs each at the interval of
three days one from another if the hen was obliged to hatch her own
eggs before the last was laid the first probably would be addled but
if each laid a few eggs at successive periods in different nests and
several hens as is stated to be the case combined together then the
eggs in one collection would be nearly of the same age if the number
of eggs in one of these nests is as i believe not greater on an
average than the number laid by one female in the season then there
must be as many nests as females and each cock bird will have its fair
share of the labour of incubation and that during a period when the
females probably could not sit from not having finished laying i
have before mentioned the great numbers of huachos or deserted eggs 
so that in one day s hunting twenty were found in this state it
appears odd that so many should be wasted does it not arise from the
difficulty of several females associating together and finding a male
ready to undertake the office of incubation it is evident that there
must at first be some degree of association between at least two
females otherwise the eggs would remain scattered over the wide plain 
at distances far too great to allow of the male collecting them into
one nest some authors have believed that the scattered eggs were
deposited for the young birds to feed on this can hardly be the case
in america because the huachos although often found addled and
putrid are generally whole 

when at the rio negro in northern patagonia i repeatedly heard the
gauchos talking of a very rare bird which they called avestruz petise 
they described it as being less than the common ostrich which is there
abundant but with a very close general resemblance they said its
colour was dark and mottled and that its legs were shorter and
feathered lower down than those of the common ostrich it is more
easily caught by the bolas than the other species the few inhabitants
who had seen both kinds affirmed they could distinguish them apart
from a long distance the eggs of the small species appeared however 
more generally known and it was remarked with surprise that they
were very little less than those of the rhea but of a slightly
different form and with a tinge of pale blue this species occurs
most rarely on the plains bordering the rio negro but about a degree
and a half further south they are tolerably abundant when at port
desire in patagonia lat degs mr martens shot an ostrich and
i looked at it forgetting at the moment in the most unaccountable
manner the whole subject of the petises and thought it was a not
full-grown bird of the common sort it was cooked and eaten before my
memory returned fortunately the head neck legs wings many of the
larger feathers and a large part of the skin had been preserved and
from these a very nearly perfect specimen has been put together and is
now exhibited in the museum of the zoological society mr gould in
describing this new species has done me the honour of calling it after
my name 

among the patagonian indians in the strait of magellan we found a half
indian who had lived some years with the tribe but had been born in
the northern provinces i asked him if he had ever heard of the
avestruz petise he answered by saying why there are none others in
these southern countries he informed me that the number of eggs in
the nest of the petise is considerably less than in that of the other
kind namely not more than fifteen on an average but he asserted that
more than one female deposited them at santa cruz we saw several of
these birds they were excessively wary i think they could see a
person approaching when too far off to be distinguished themselves in
ascending the river few were seen but in our quiet and rapid descent 
many in pairs and by fours or fives were observed it was remarked
that this bird did not expand its wings when first starting at full
speed after the manner of the northern kind in conclusion i may
observe that the struthio rhea inhabits the country of la plata as far
as a little south of the rio negro in lat degs and that the
struthio darwinii takes its place in southern patagonia the part about
the rio negro being neutral territory m a d orbigny when at
the rio negro made great exertions to procure this bird but never had
the good fortune to succeed dobrizhoffer long ago was aware of
there being two kinds of ostriches he says you must know moreover 
that emus differ in size and habits in different tracts of land for
those that inhabit the plains of buenos ayres and tucuman are larger 
and have black white and grey feathers those near to the strait of
magellan are smaller and more beautiful for their white feathers are
tipped with black at the extremity and their black ones in like manner
terminate in white 

a very singular little bird tinochorus rumicivorus is here common in
its habits and general appearance it nearly equally partakes of the
characters different as they are of the quail and snipe the
tinochorus is found in the whole of southern south america wherever
there are sterile plains or open dry pasture land it frequents in
pairs or small flocks the most desolate places where scarcely another
living creature can exist upon being approached they squat close and
then are very difficult to be distinguished from the ground when
feeding they walk rather slowly with their legs wide apart they dust
themselves in roads and sandy places and frequent particular spots 
where they may be found day after day like partridges they take wing
in a flock in all these respects in the muscular gizzard adapted for
vegetable food in the arched beak and fleshy nostrils short legs and
form of foot the tinochorus has a close affinity with quails but as
soon as the bird is seen flying its whole appearance changes the long
pointed wings so different from those in the gallinaceous order the
irregular manner of flight and plaintive cry uttered at the moment of
rising recall the idea of a snipe the sportsmen of the beagle
unanimously called it the short-billed snipe to this genus or rather
to the family of the waders its skeleton shows that it is really
related 

the tinochorus is closely related to some other south american birds 
two species of the genus attagis are in almost every respect ptarmigans
in their habits one lives in tierra del fuego above the limits of the
forest land and the other just beneath the snow-line on the cordillera
of central chile a bird of another closely allied genus chionis
alba is an inhabitant of the antarctic regions it feeds on sea-weed
and shells on the tidal rocks although not web footed from some
unaccountable habit it is frequently met with far out at sea this
small family of birds is one of those which from its varied relations
to other families although at present offering only difficulties to
the systematic naturalist ultimately may assist in revealing the grand
scheme common to the present and past ages on which organized beings
have been created 

the genus furnarius contains several species all small birds living
on the ground and inhabiting open dry countries in structure they
cannot be compared to any european form ornithologists have generally
included them among the creepers although opposed to that family in
every habit the best known species is the common oven-bird of la
plata the casara or housemaker of the spaniards the nest whence it
takes its name is placed in the most exposed situations as on the top
of a post a bare rock or on a cactus it is composed of mud and bits
of straw and has strong thick walls in shape it precisely resembles
an oven or depressed beehive the opening is large and arched and
directly in front within the nest there is a partition which reaches
nearly to the roof thus forming a passage or antechamber to the true
nest 

another and smaller species of furnarius f cunicularius resembles
the oven-bird in the general reddish tint of its plumage in a peculiar
shrill reiterated cry and in an odd manner of running by starts from
its affinity the spaniards call it casarita or little housebuilder 
although its nidification is quite different the casarita builds its
nest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole which is said to
extend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground several of the
country people told me that when boys they had attempted to dig out
the nest but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end of the
passage the bird chooses any low bank of firm sandy soil by the side
of a road or stream here at bahia blanca the walls round the houses
are built of hardened mud and i noticed that one which enclosed a
courtyard where i lodged was bored through by round holes in a score
of places on asking the owner the cause of this he bitterly
complained of the little casarita several of which i afterwards
observed at work it is rather curious to find how incapable these
birds must be of acquiring any notion of thickness for although they
were constantly flitting over the low wall they continued vainly to
bore through it thinking it an excellent bank for their nests i do
not doubt that each bird as often as it came to daylight on the
opposite side was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact 

i have already mentioned nearly all the mammalia common in this
country of armadilloes three species occur namely the dasypus
minutus or pichy the d villosus or peludo and the apar the
first extends ten degrees further south than any other kind a fourth
species the mulita does not come as far south as bahia blanca the
four species have nearly similar habits the peludo however is
nocturnal while the others wander by day over the open plains feeding
on beetles larvae roots and even small snakes the apar commonly
called mataco is remarkable by having only three moveable bands the
rest of its tesselated covering being nearly inflexible it has the
power of rolling itself into a perfect sphere like one kind of english
woodlouse in this state it is safe from the attack of dogs for the
dog not being able to take the whole in its mouth tries to bite one
side and the ball slips away the smooth hard covering of the
 mataco offers a better defence than the sharp spines of the hedgehog 
the pichy prefers a very dry soil and the sand-dunes near the coast 
where for many months it can never taste water is its favourite
resort it often tries to escape notice by squatting close to the
ground in the course of a day s ride near bahia blanca several were
generally met with the instant one was perceived it was necessary 
in order to catch it almost to tumble off one s horse for in soft
soil the animal burrowed so quickly that its hinder quarters would
almost disappear before one could alight it seems almost a pity to
kill such nice little animals for as a gaucho said while sharpening
his knife on the back of one son tan mansos they are so quiet 

of reptiles there are many kinds one snake a trigonocephalus or
cophias from the size of the poison channel in its fangs must
be very deadly cuvier in opposition to some other naturalists makes
this a sub-genus of the rattlesnake and intermediate between it and
the viper in confirmation of this opinion i observed a fact which
appears to me very curious and instructive as showing how every
character even though it may be in some degree independent of
structure has a tendency to vary by slow degrees the extremity of the
tail of this snake is terminated by a point which is very slightly
enlarged and as the animal glides along it constantly vibrates the
last inch and this part striking against the dry grass and brushwood 
produces a rattling noise which can be distinctly heard at the
distance of six feet as often as the animal was irritated or
surprised its tail was shaken and the vibrations were extremely
rapid even as long as the body retained its irritability a tendency
to this habitual movement was evident this trigonocephalus has 
therefore in some respects the structure of a viper with the habits
of a rattlesnake the noise however being produced by a simpler
device the expression of this snake s face was hideous and fierce 
the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris 
the jaws were broad at the base and the nose terminated in a
triangular projection i do not think i ever saw anything more ugly 
excepting perhaps some of the vampire bats i imagine this repulsive
aspect originates from the features being placed in positions with
respect to each other somewhat proportional to those of the human
face and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness 

amongst the batrachian reptiles i found only one little toad
 phryniscus nigricans which was most singular from its colour if we
imagine first that it had been steeped in the blackest ink and then 
when dry allowed to crawl over a board freshly painted with the
brightest vermilion so as to colour the soles of its feet and parts of
its stomach a good idea of its appearance will be gained if it had
been an unnamed species surely it ought to have been called
 diabolicus for it is a fit toad to preach in the ear of eve instead
of being nocturnal in its habits as other toads are and living in
damp obscure recesses it crawls during the heat of the day about the
dry sand-hillocks and arid plains where not a single drop of water can
be found it must necessarily depend on the dew for its moisture and
this probably is absorbed by the skin for it is known that these
reptiles possess great powers of cutaneous absorption at maldonado i
found one in a situation nearly as dry as at bahia blanca and thinking
to give it a great treat carried it to a pool of water not only was
the little animal unable to swim but i think without help it would
soon have been drowned of lizards there were many kinds but only one
 proctotretus multimaculatus remarkable from its habits it lives on
the bare sand near the sea coast and from its mottled colour the
brownish scales being speckled with white yellowish red and dirty
blue can hardly be distinguished from the surrounding surface when
frightened it attempts to avoid discovery by feigning death with
outstretched legs depressed body and closed eyes if further
molested it buries itself with great quickness in the loose sand this
lizard from its flattened body and short legs cannot run quickly 

i will here add a few remarks on the hybernation of animals in this
part of south america when we first arrived at bahia blanca 
september th we thought nature had granted scarcely a living
creature to this sandy and dry country by digging however in the
ground several insects large spiders and lizards were found in a
half-torpid state on the th a few animals began to appear and by
the th three days from the equinox everything announced the
commencement of spring the plains were ornamented by the flowers of a
pink wood-sorrel wild peas cenotherae and geraniums and the birds
began to lay their eggs numerous lamellicorn and heteromerous
insects the latter remarkable for their deeply sculptured bodies were
slowly crawling about while the lizard tribe the constant inhabitants
of a sandy soil darted about in every direction during the first
eleven days whilst nature was dormant the mean temperature taken from
observations made every two hours on board the beagle was degs 
and in the middle of the day the thermometer seldom ranged above 
degs on the eleven succeeding days in which all living things became
so animated the mean was degs and the range in the middle of the
day between and degs here then an increase of seven degrees
in mean temperature but a greater one of extreme heat was sufficient
to awake the functions of life at monte video from which we had just
before sailed in the twenty-three days included between the th of
july and the th of august the mean temperature from observations
was degs the mean hottest day being degs and the coldest
 degs the lowest point to which the thermometer fell was 
degs and occasionally in the middle of the day it rose to or 
degs yet with this high temperature almost every beetle several
genera of spiders snails and land-shells toads and lizards were all
lying torpid beneath stones but we have seen that at bahia blanca 
which is four degrees southward and therefore with a climate only a
very little colder this same temperature with a rather less extreme
heat was sufficient to awake all orders of animated beings this shows
how nicely the stimulus required to arouse hybernating animals is
governed by the usual climate of the district and not by the absolute
heat it is well known that within the tropics the hybernation or
more properly aestivation of animals is determined not by the
temperature but by the times of drought near rio de janeiro i was
at first surprised to observe that a few days after some little
depressions had been filled with water they were peopled by numerous
full-grown shells and beetles which must have been lying dormant 
humboldt has related the strange accident of a hovel having been
erected over a spot where a young crocodile lay buried in the hardened
mud he adds the indians often find enormous boas which they call
uji or water serpents in the same lethargic state to reanimate them 
they must be irritated or wetted with water 

i will only mention one other animal a zoophyte i believe virgularia
patagonica a kind of sea-pen it consists of a thin straight 
fleshy stem with alternate rows of polypi on each side and
surrounding an elastic stony axis varying in length from eight inches
to two feet the stem at one extremity is truncate but at the other
is terminated by a vermiform fleshy appendage the stony axis which
gives strength to the stem may be traced at this extremity into a mere
vessel filled with granular matter at low water hundreds of these
zoophytes might be seen projecting like stubble with the truncate end
upwards a few inches above the surface of the muddy sand when
touched or pulled they suddenly drew themselves in with force so as
nearly or quite to disappear by this action the highly elastic axis
must be bent at the lower extremity where it is naturally slightly
curved and i imagine it is by this elasticity alone that the zoophyte
is enabled to rise again through the mud each polypus though closely
united to its brethren has a distinct mouth body and tentacula of
these polypi in a large specimen there must be many thousands yet we
see that they act by one movement they have also one central axis
connected with a system of obscure circulation and the ova are
produced in an organ distinct from the separate individuals well
may one be allowed to ask what is an individual it is always
interesting to discover the foundation of the strange tales of the old
voyagers and i have no doubt but that the habits of this virgularia
explain one such case captain lancaster in his voyage in 
narrates that on the sea-sands of the island of sombrero in the east
indies he found a small twig growing up like a young tree and on
offering to pluck it up it shrinks down to the ground and sinks 
unless held very hard on being plucked up a great worm is found to
be its root and as the tree groweth in greatness so doth the worm
diminish and as soon as the worm is entirely turned into a tree it
rooteth in the earth and so becomes great this transformation is one
of the strangest wonders that i saw in all my travels for if this tree
is plucked up while young and the leaves and bark stripped off it
becomes a hard stone when dry much like white coral thus is this worm
twice transformed into different natures of these we gathered and
brought home many 


during my stay at bahia blanca while waiting for the beagle the place
was in a constant state of excitement from rumours of wars and
victories between the troops of rosas and the wild indians one day
an account came that a small party forming one of the postas on the
line to buenos ayres had been found all murdered the next day three
hundred men arrived from the colorado under the command of commandant
miranda a large portion of these men were indians mansos or tame 
belonging to the tribe of the cacique bernantio they passed the night
here and it was impossible to conceive anything more wild and savage
than the scene of their bivouac some drank till they were
intoxicated others swallowed the steaming blood of the cattle
slaughtered for their suppers and then being sick from drunkenness 
they cast it up again and were besmeared with filth and gore 

nam simul expletus dapibus vinoque sepultus cervicem inflexam posuit 
jacuitque per antrum immensus saniem eructans ac frusta cruenta per
somnum commixta mero 

in the morning they started for the scene of the murder with orders to
follow the rastro or track even if it led them to chile we
subsequently heard that the wild indians had escaped into the great
pampas and from some cause the track had been missed one glance at
the rastro tells these people a whole history supposing they examine
the track of a thousand horses they will soon guess the number of
mounted ones by seeing how many have cantered by the depth of the
other impressions whether any horses were loaded with cargoes by the
irregularity of the footsteps how far tired by the manner in which
the food has been cooked whether the pursued travelled in haste by
the general appearance how long it has been since they passed they
consider a rastro of ten days or a fortnight quite recent enough to be
hunted out we also heard that miranda struck from the west end of the
sierra ventana in a direct line to the island of cholechel situated
seventy leagues up the rio negro this is a distance of between two
and three hundred miles through a country completely unknown what
other troops in the world are so independent with the sun for their
guide mare s flesh for food their saddle-cloths for beds as long as
there is a little water these men would penetrate to the end of the
world 

a few days afterwards i saw another troop of these banditti-like
soldiers start on an expedition against a tribe of indians at the small
salinas who had been betrayed by a prisoner cacique the spaniard who
brought the orders for this expedition was a very intelligent man he
gave me an account of the last engagement at which he was present some
indians who had been taken prisoners gave information of a tribe
living north of the colorado two hundred soldiers were sent and they
first discovered the indians by a cloud of dust from their horses 
feet as they chanced to be travelling the country was mountainous
and wild and it must have been far in the interior for the cordillera
were in sight the indians men women and children were about one
hundred and ten in number and they were nearly all taken or killed 
for the soldiers sabre every man the indians are now so terrified
that they offer no resistance in a body but each flies neglecting
even his wife and children but when overtaken like wild animals they
fight against any number to the last moment one dying indian seized
with his teeth the thumb of his adversary and allowed his own eye to
be forced out sooner than relinquish his hold another who was
wounded feigned death keeping a knife ready to strike one more fatal
blow my informer said when he was pursuing an indian the man cried
out for mercy at the same time that he was covertly loosing the bolas
from his waist meaning to whirl it round his head and so strike his
pursuer i however struck him with my sabre to the ground and then
got off my horse and cut his throat with my knife this is a dark
picture but how much more shocking is the unquestionable fact that
all the women who appear above twenty years old are massacred in cold
blood when i exclaimed that this appeared rather inhuman he answered 
 why what can be done they breed so 

every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war 
because it is against barbarians who would believe in this age that
such atrocities could be committed in a christian civilized country 
the children of the indians are saved to be sold or given away as
servants or rather slaves for as long a time as the owners can make
them believe themselves slaves but i believe in their treatment there
is little to complain of 

in the battle four men ran away together they were pursued one was
killed and the other three were taken alive they turned out to be
messengers or ambassadors from a large body of indians united in the
common cause of defence near the cordillera the tribe to which they
had been sent was on the point of holding a grand council the feast of
mare s flesh was ready and the dance prepared in the morning the
ambassadors were to have returned to the cordillera they were
remarkably fine men very fair above six feet high and all under
thirty years of age the three survivors of course possessed very
valuable information and to extort this they were placed in a line the
two first being questioned answered no se i do not know and were
one after the other shot the third also said no se adding fire 
i am a man and can die not one syllable would they breathe to injure
the united cause of their country the conduct of the above-mentioned
cacique was very different he saved his life by betraying the intended
plan of warfare and the point of union in the andes it was believed
that there were already six or seven hundred indians together and that
in summer their numbers would be doubled ambassadors were to have been
sent to the indians at the small salinas near bahia blanca whom i
have mentioned that this same cacique had betrayed the communication 
therefore between the indians extends from the cordillera to the
coast of the atlantic 

general rosas s plan is to kill all stragglers and having driven the
remainder to a common point to attack them in a body in the summer 
with the assistance of the chilenos this operation is to be repeated
for three successive years i imagine the summer is chosen as the time
for the main attack because the plains are then without water and the
indians can only travel in particular directions the escape of the
indians to the south of the rio negro where in such a vast unknown
country they would be safe is prevented by a treaty with the
tehuelches to this effect that rosas pays them so much to slaughter
every indian who passes to the south of the river but if they fail in
so doing they themselves are to be exterminated the war is waged
chiefly against the indians near the cordillera for many of the tribes
on this eastern side are fighting with rosas the general however 
like lord chesterfield thinking that his friends may in a future day
become his enemies always places them in the front ranks so that
their numbers may be thinned since leaving south america we have
heard that this war of extermination completely failed 

among the captive girls taken in the same engagement there were two
very pretty spanish ones who had been carried away by the indians when
young and could now only speak the indian tongue from their account
they must have come from salta a distance in a straight line of nearly
one thousand miles this gives one a grand idea of the immense
territory over which the indians roam yet great as it is i think
there will not in another half-century be a wild indian northward of
the rio negro the warfare is too bloody to last the christians
killing every indian and the indians doing the same by the christians 
it is melancholy to trace how the indians have given way before the
spanish invaders schirdel says that in when buenos ayres
was founded there were villages containing two and three thousand
inhabitants even in falconer s time the indians made inroads
as far as luxan areco and arrecife but now they are driven beyond
the salado not only have whole tribes been exterminated but the
remaining indians have become more barbarous instead of living in
large villages and being employed in the arts of fishing as well as
of the chase they now wander about the open plains without home or
fixed occupation 

i heard also some account of an engagement which took place a few
weeks previously to the one mentioned at cholechel this is a very
important station on account of being a pass for horses and it was in
consequence for some time the head-quarters of a division of the army 
when the troops first arrived there they found a tribe of indians of
whom they killed twenty or thirty the cacique escaped in a manner
which astonished every one the chief indians always have one or two
picked horses which they keep ready for any urgent occasion on one
of these an old white horse the cacique sprung taking with him his
little son the horse had neither saddle nor bridle to avoid the
shots the indian rode in the peculiar method of his nation namely 
with an arm round the horse s neck and one leg only on its back thus
hanging on one side he was seen patting the horse s head and talking
to him the pursuers urged every effort in the chase the commandant
three times changed his horse but all in vain the old indian father
and his son escaped and were free what a fine picture one can form
in one s mind the naked bronze-like figure of the old man with his
little boy riding like a mazeppa on the white horse thus leaving far
behind him the host of his pursuers 

i saw one day a soldier striking fire with a piece of flint which i
immediately recognised as having been a part of the head of an arrow 
he told me it was found near the island of cholechel and that they are
frequently picked up there it was between two and three inches long 
and therefore twice as large as those now used in tierra del fuego it
was made of opaque cream-coloured flint but the point and barbs had
been intentionally broken off it is well known that no pampas indians
now use bows and arrows i believe a small tribe in banda oriental
must be excepted but they are widely separated from the pampas
indians and border close on those tribes that inhabit the forest and
live on foot it appears therefore that these arrow-heads are
antiquarian relics of the indians before the great change in
habits consequent on the introduction of the horse into south america 

 since this was written m alcide d orbingy has examined these
shells and pronounces them all to be recent 

 m aug bravard has described in a spanish work observaciones
geologicas this district and he believes that the bones of
the extinct mammals were washed out of the underlying pampean deposit 
and subsequently became embedded with the still existing shells but i
am not convinced by his remarks m bravard believes that the whole
enormous pampean deposit is a sub-aerial formation like sand-dunes 
this seems to me to be an untenable doctrine

 the elephant which was killed at exeter change was estimated being
partly weighed at five tons and a half the elephant actress as i was
informed weighed one ton less so that we may take five as the average
of a full-grown elephant i was told at the surry gardens that a
hippopotamus which was sent to england cut up into pieces was estimated
at three tons and a half we will call it three from these premises
we may give three tons and a half to each of the five rhinoceroses 
perhaps a ton to the giraffe and half to the bos caffer as well as to
the elan a large ox weighs from to pounds this will give
an average from the above estimates of of a ton for the ten
largest herbivorous animals of southern africa in south america 
allowing pounds for the two tapirs together for the guanaco
and vicuna for three deer for the capybara peccari and a
monkey we shall have an average of pounds which i believe is
overstating the result the ratio will therefore be as to or
 to for the ten largest animals from the two continents 

 if we suppose the case of the discovery of a skeleton of a
greenland whale in a fossil state not a single cetaceous animal being
known to exist what naturalist would have ventured conjecture on the
possibility of a carcass so gigantic being supported on the minute
crustacea and mollusca living in the frozen seas of the extreme north 

 see zoological remarks to capt back s expedition by dr 
richardson he says the subsoil north of latitude degs is

for forests flourish on the surface at a distance from the coast

 the cavities leading from the fleshy compartments of the
extremity were filled with a yellow pulpy matter which examined
under a microscope presented an extraordinary appearance the mass
consisted of rounded semi-transparent irregular grains aggregated
together into particles of various sizes all such particles and the
separate grains possessed the power of rapid movement generally
revolving around different axes but sometimes progressive the
movement was visible with a very weak power but even with the highest
its cause could not be perceived it was very different from the
circulation of the fluid in the elastic bag containing the thin
extremity of the axis on other occasions when dissecting small
marine animals beneath the microscope i have seen particles of pulpy
matter some of large size as soon as they were disengaged commence
revolving i have imagined i know not with how much truth that this
granulo-pulpy matter was in process of being converted into ova 
certainly in this zoophyte such appeared to be the case

september th i hired a gaucho to accompany me on my ride to buenos
ayres though with some difficulty as the father of one man was afraid
to let him go and another who seemed willing was described to me as
so fearful that i was afraid to take him for i was told that even if
he saw an ostrich at a distance he would mistake it for an indian and
would fly like the wind away the distance to buenos ayres is about
four hundred miles and nearly the whole way through an uninhabited
country we started early in the morning ascending a few hundred feet
from the basin of green turf on which bahia blanca stands we entered
on a wide desolate plain it consists of a crumbling
argillaceo-calcareous rock which from the dry nature of the climate 
supports only scattered tufts of withered grass without a single bush
or tree to break the monotonous uniformity the weather was fine but
the atmosphere remarkably hazy i thought the appearance foreboded a
gale but the gauchos said it was owing to the plain at some great
distance in the interior being on fire after a long gallop having
changed horses twice we reached the rio sauce it is a deep rapid 
little stream not above twenty-five feet wide the second posta on
the road to buenos ayres stands on its banks a little above there is a
ford for horses where the water does not reach to the horses belly 
but from that point in its course to the sea it is quite impassable 
and hence makes a most useful barrier against the indians 

insignificant as this stream is the jesuit falconer whose information
is generally so very correct figures it as a considerable river 
rising at the foot of the cordillera with respect to its source i do
not doubt that this is the case for the gauchos assured me that in the
middle of the dry summer this stream at the same time with the
colorado has periodical floods which can only originate in the snow
melting on the andes it is extremely improbable that a stream so
small as the sauce then was should traverse the entire width of the
continent and indeed if it were the residue of a large river its
waters as in other ascertained cases would be saline during the
winter we must look to the springs round the sierra ventana as the
source of its pure and limpid stream i suspect the plains of
patagonia like those of australia are traversed by many water-courses
which only perform their proper parts at certain periods probably this
is the case with the water which flows into the head of port desire 
and likewise with the rio chupat on the banks of which masses of
highly cellular scoriae were found by the officers employed in the
survey 

as it was early in the afternoon when we arrived we took fresh horses 
and a soldier for a guide and started for the sierra de la ventana 
this mountain is visible from the anchorage at bahia blanca and capt 
fitz roy calculates its height to be feet an altitude very
remarkable on this eastern side of the continent i am not aware that
any foreigner previous to my visit had ascended this mountain and
indeed very few of the soldiers at bahia blanca knew anything about it 
hence we heard of beds of coal of gold and silver of caves and of
forests all of which inflamed my curiosity only to disappoint it the
distance from the posta was about six leagues over a level plain of the
same character as before the ride was however interesting as the
mountain began to show its true form when we reached the foot of the
main ridge we had much difficulty in finding any water and we thought
we should have been obliged to have passed the night without any at
last we discovered some by looking close to the mountain for at the
distance even of a few hundred yards the streamlets were buried and
entirely lost in the friable calcareous stone and loose detritus i do
not think nature ever made a more solitary desolate pile of rock it
well deserves its name of hurtado or separated the mountain is
steep extremely rugged and broken and so entirely destitute of
trees and even bushes that we actually could not make a skewer to
stretch out our meat over the fire of thistle-stalks the strange
aspect of this mountain is contrasted by the sea-like plain which not
only abuts against its steep sides but likewise separates the parallel
ranges the uniformity of the colouring gives an extreme quietness to
the view the whitish grey of the quartz rock and the light brown of
the withered grass of the plain being unrelieved by any brighter tint 
from custom one expects to see in the neighbourhood of a lofty and
bold mountain a broken country strewed over with huge fragments here
nature shows that the last movement before the bed of the sea is
changed into dry land may sometimes be one of tranquillity under these
circumstances i was curious to observe how far from the parent rock any
pebbles could be found on the shores of bahia blanca and near the
settlement there were some of quartz which certainly must have come
from this source the distance is forty-five miles 

the dew which in the early part of the night wetted the saddle-cloths
under which we slept was in the morning frozen the plain though
appearing horizontal had insensibly sloped up to a height of between
 and feet above the sea in the morning th of september the
guide told me to ascend the nearest ridge which he thought would lead
me to the four peaks that crown the summit the climbing up such rough
rocks was very fatiguing the sides were so indented that what was
gained in one five minutes was often lost in the next at last when i
reached the ridge my disappointment was extreme in finding a
precipitous valley as deep as the plain which cut the chain
transversely in two and separated me from the four points this
valley is very narrow but flat-bottomed and it forms a fine
horse-pass for the indians as it connects the plains on the northern
and southern sides of the range having descended and while crossing
it i saw two horses grazing i immediately hid myself in the long
grass and began to reconnoitre but as i could see no signs of indians
i proceeded cautiously on my second ascent it was late in the day 
and this part of the mountain like the other was steep and rugged i
was on the top of the second peak by two o clock but got there with
extreme difficulty every twenty yards i had the cramp in the upper
part of both thighs so that i was afraid i should not have been able
to have got down again it was also necessary to return by another
road as it was out of the question to pass over the saddle-back i
was therefore obliged to give up the two higher peaks their altitude
was but little greater and every purpose of geology had been answered 
so that the attempt was not worth the hazard of any further exertion i
presume the cause of the cramp was the great change in the kind of
muscular action from that of hard riding to that of still harder
climbing it is a lesson worth remembering as in some cases it might
cause much difficulty 

i have already said the mountain is composed of white quartz rock and
with it a little glossy clay-slate is associated at the height of a
few hundred feet above the plain patches of conglomerate adhered in
several places to the solid rock they resembled in hardness and in
the nature of the cement the masses which may be seen daily forming on
some coasts i do not doubt these pebbles were in a similar manner
aggregated at a period when the great calcareous formation was
depositing beneath the surrounding sea we may believe that the jagged
and battered forms of the hard quartz yet show the effects of the waves
of an open ocean 

i was on the whole disappointed with this ascent even the view was
insignificant a plain like the sea but without its beautiful colour
and defined outline the scene however was novel and a little
danger like salt to meat gave it a relish that the danger was very
little was certain for my two companions made a good fire a thing
which is never done when it is suspected that indians are near i
reached the place of our bivouac by sunset and drinking much mate and
smoking several cigaritos soon made up my bed for the night the wind
was very strong and cold but i never slept more comfortably 

september th in the morning having fairly scudded before the gale 
we arrived by the middle of the day at the sauce posta in the road we
saw great numbers of deer and near the mountain a guanaco the plain 
which abuts against the sierra is traversed by some curious gullies 
of which one was about twenty feet wide and at least thirty deep we
were obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit before we
could find a pass we stayed the night at the posta the conversation 
as was generally the case being about the indians the sierra ventana
was formerly a great place of resort and three or four years ago there
was much fighting there my guide had been present when many indians
were killed the women escaped to the top of the ridge and fought most
desperately with great stones many thus saving themselves 

september th proceeded to the third posta in company with the
lieutenant who commanded it the distance is called fifteen leagues 
but it is only guess-work and is generally overstated the road was
uninteresting over a dry grassy plain and on our left hand at a
greater or less distance there were some low hills a continuation of
which we crossed close to the posta before our arrival we met a large
herd of cattle and horses guarded by fifteen soldiers but we were
told many had been lost it is very difficult to drive animals across
the plains for if in the night a puma or even a fox approaches 
nothing can prevent the horses dispersing in every direction and a
storm will have the same effect a short time since an officer left
buenos ayres with five hundred horses and when he arrived at the army
he had under twenty 

soon afterwards we perceived by the cloud of dust that a party of
horsemen were coming towards us when far distant my companions knew
them to be indians by their long hair streaming behind their backs 
the indians generally have a fillet round their heads but never any
covering and their black hair blowing across their swarthy faces 
heightens to an uncommon degree the wildness of their appearance they
turned out to be a party of bernantio s friendly tribe going to a
salina for salt the indians eat much salt their children sucking it
like sugar this habit is very different from that of the spanish
gauchos who leading the same kind of life eat scarcely any 
according to mungo park it is people who live on vegetable food
who have an unconquerable desire for salt the indians gave us
good-humoured nods as they passed at full gallop driving before them a
troop of horses and followed by a train of lanky dogs 

september th and th i stayed at this posta two days waiting for
a troop of soldiers which general rosas had the kindness to send to
inform me would shortly travel to buenos ayres and he advised me to
take the opportunity of the escort in the morning we rode to some
neighbouring hills to view the country and to examine the geology 
after dinner the soldiers divided themselves into two parties for a
trial of skill with the bolas two spears were stuck in the ground
twenty-five yards apart but they were struck and entangled only once
in four or five times the balls can be thrown fifty or sixty yards 
but with little certainty this however does not apply to a man on
horseback for when the speed of the horse is added to the force of the
arm it is said that they can be whirled with effect to the distance
of eighty yards as a proof of their force i may mention that at the
falkland islands when the spaniards murdered some of their own
countrymen and all the englishmen a young friendly spaniard was
running away when a great tall man by name luciano came at full
gallop after him shouting to him to stop and saying that he only
wanted to speak to him just as the spaniard was on the point of
reaching the boat luciano threw the balls they struck him on the legs
with such a jerk as to throw him down and to render him for some time
insensible the man after luciano had had his talk was allowed to
escape he told us that his legs were marked by great weals where the
thong had wound round as if he had been flogged with a whip in the
middle of the day two men arrived who brought a parcel from the next
posta to be forwarded to the general so that besides these two our
party consisted this evening of my guide and self the lieutenant and
his four soldiers the latter were strange beings the first a fine
young negro the second half indian and negro and the two others
non-descripts namely an old chilian miner the colour of mahogany 
and another partly a mulatto but two such mongrels with such
detestable expressions i never saw before at night when they were
sitting round the fire and playing at cards i retired to view such a
salvator rosa scene they were seated under a low cliff so that i
could look down upon them around the party were lying dogs arms 
remnants of deer and ostriches and their long spears were stuck in the
turf further in the dark background their horses were tied up ready
for any sudden danger if the stillness of the desolate plain was
broken by one of the dogs barking a soldier leaving the fire would
place his head close to the ground and thus slowly scan the horizon 
even if the noisy teru-tero uttered its scream there would be a pause
in the conversation and every head for a moment a little inclined 

what a life of misery these men appear to us to lead they were at
least ten leagues from the sauce posta and since the murder committed
by the indians twenty from another the indians are supposed to have
made their attack in the middle of the night for very early in the
morning after the murder they were luckily seen approaching this
posta the whole party here however escaped together with the troop
of horses each one taking a line for himself and driving with him as
many animals as he was able to manage 

the little hovel built of thistle-stalks in which they slept neither
kept out the wind nor rain indeed in the latter case the only effect
the roof had was to condense it into larger drops they had nothing
to eat excepting what they could catch such as ostriches deer 
armadilloes etc and their only fuel was the dry stalks of a small
plant somewhat resembling an aloe the sole luxury which these men
enjoyed was smoking the little paper cigars and sucking mate i used
to think that the carrion vultures man s constant attendants on these
dreary plains while seated on the little neighbouring cliffs seemed by
their very patience to say ah when the indians come we shall have a
feast 

in the morning we all sallied forth to hunt and although we had not
much success there were some animated chases soon after starting the
party separated and so arranged their plans that at a certain time of
the day in guessing which they show much skill they should all meet
from different points of the compass on a plain piece of ground and
thus drive together the wild animals one day i went out hunting at
bahia blanca but the men there merely rode in a crescent each being
about a quarter of a mile apart from the other a fine male ostrich
being turned by the headmost riders tried to escape on one side the
gauchos pursued at a reckless pace twisting their horses about with
the most admirable command and each man whirling the balls round his
head at length the foremost threw them revolving through the air in
an instant the ostrich rolled over and over its legs fairly lashed
together by the thong the plains abound with three kinds of partridge 
 two of which are as large as hen pheasants their destroyer a
small and pretty fox was also singularly numerous in the course of
the day we could not have seen less than forty or fifty they were
generally near their earths but the dogs killed one when we returned
to the posta we found two of the party returned who had been hunting
by themselves they had killed a puma and had found an ostrich s nest
with twenty-seven eggs in it each of these is said to equal in weight
eleven hen s eggs so that we obtained from this one nest as much food
as hen s eggs would have given 

september th as the soldiers belonging to the next posta meant to
return and we should together make a party of five and all armed i
determined not to wait for the expected troops my host the
lieutenant pressed me much to stop as he had been very obliging not
only providing me with food but lending me his private horses i
wanted to make him some remuneration i asked my guide whether i might
do so but he told me certainly not that the only answer i should
receive probably would be we have meat for the dogs in our country 
and therefore do not grudge it to a christian it must not be supposed
that the rank of lieutenant in such an army would at all prevent the
acceptance of payment it was only the high sense of hospitality which
every traveller is bound to acknowledge as nearly universal throughout
these provinces after galloping some leagues we came to a low swampy
country which extends for nearly eighty miles northward as far as the
sierra tapalguen in some parts there were fine damp plains covered
with grass while others had a soft black and peaty soil there were
also many extensive but shallow lakes and large beds of reeds the
country on the whole resembled the better parts of the cambridgeshire
fens at night we had some difficulty in finding amidst the swamps a
dry place for our bivouac 

september th rose very early in the morning and shortly after
passed the posta where the indians had murdered the five soldiers the
officer had eighteen chuzo wounds in his body by the middle of the
day after a hard gallop we reached the fifth posta on account of
some difficulty in procuring horses we stayed there the night as this
point was the most exposed on the whole line twenty-one soldiers were
stationed here at sunset they returned from hunting bringing with
them seven deer three ostriches and many armadilloes and partridges 
when riding through the country it is a common practice to set fire to
the plain and hence at night as on this occasion the horizon was
illuminated in several places by brilliant conflagrations this is done
partly for the sake of puzzling any stray indians but chiefly for
improving the pasture in grassy plains unoccupied by the larger
ruminating quadrupeds it seems necessary to remove the superfluous
vegetation by fire so as to render the new year s growth serviceable 

the rancho at this place did not boast even of a roof but merely
consisted of a ring of thistle-stalks to break the force of the wind 
it was situated on the borders of an extensive but shallow lake 
swarming with wild fowl among which the black-necked swan was
conspicuous 

the kind of plover which appears as if mounted on stilts himantopus
nigricollis is here common in flocks of considerable size it has
been wrongfully accused of inelegance when wading about in shallow
water which is its favourite resort its gait is far from awkward 
these birds in a flock utter a noise that singularly resembles the cry
of a pack of small dogs in full chase waking in the night i have more
than once been for a moment startled at the distant sound the
teru-tero vanellus cayanus is another bird which often disturbs the
stillness of the night in appearance and habits it resembles in many
respects our peewits its wings however are armed with sharp spurs 
like those on the legs of the common cock as our peewit takes its
name from the sound of its voice so does the teru-tero while riding
over the grassy plains one is constantly pursued by these birds which
appear to hate mankind and i am sure deserve to be hated for their
never-ceasing unvaried harsh screams to the sportsman they are most
annoying by telling every other bird and animal of his approach to
the traveller in the country they may possibly as molina says do
good by warning him of the midnight robber during the breeding
season they attempt like our peewits by feigning to be wounded to
draw away from their nests dogs and other enemies the eggs of this
bird are esteemed a great delicacy 

september th to the seventh posta at the foot of the sierra
tapalguen the country was quite level with a coarse herbage and a
soft peaty soil the hovel was here remarkably neat the posts and
rafters being made of about a dozen dry thistle-stalks bound together
with thongs of hide and by the support of these ionic-like columns 
the roof and sides were thatched with reeds we were here told a fact 
which i would not have credited if i had not had partly ocular proof
of it namely that during the previous night hail as large as small
apples and extremely hard had fallen with such violence as to kill
the greater number of the wild animals one of the men had already
found thirteen deer cervus campestris lying dead and i saw their
 fresh hides another of the party a few minutes after my arrival
brought in seven more now i well know that one man without dogs
could hardly have killed seven deer in a week the men believed they
had seen about fifteen ostriches part of one of which we had for
dinner and they said that several were running about evidently blind
in one eye numbers of smaller birds as ducks hawks and partridges 
were killed i saw one of the latter with a black mark on its back as
if it had been struck with a paving-stone a fence of thistle-stalks
round the hovel was nearly broken down and my informer putting his
head out to see what was the matter received a severe cut and now
wore a bandage the storm was said to have been of limited extent we
certainly saw from our last night s bivouac a dense cloud and lightning
in this direction it is marvellous how such strong animals as deer
could thus have been killed but i have no doubt from the evidence i
have given that the story is not in the least exaggerated i am glad 
however to have its credibility supported by the jesuit dobrizhoffen 
 who speaking of a country much to the northward says hail fell
of an enormous size and killed vast numbers of cattle the indians
hence called the place lalegraicavalca meaning the little white
things dr malcolmson also informs me that he witnessed in in
india a hail-storm which killed numbers of large birds and much
injured the cattle these hailstones were flat and one was ten inches
in circumference and another weighed two ounces they ploughed up a
gravel-walk like musket-balls and passed through glass-windows making
round holes but not cracking them 

having finished our dinner of hail-stricken meat we crossed the
sierra tapalguen a low range of hills a few hundred feet in height 
which commences at cape corrientes the rock in this part is pure
quartz further eastward i understand it is granitic the hills are of
a remarkable form they consist of flat patches of table-land 
surrounded by low perpendicular cliffs like the outliers of a
sedimentary deposit the hill which i ascended was very small not
above a couple of hundred yards in diameter but i saw others larger 
one which goes by the name of the corral is said to be two or three
miles in diameter and encompassed by perpendicular cliffs between
thirty and forty feet high excepting at one spot where the entrance
lies falconer gives a curious account of the indians driving
troops of wild horses into it and then by guarding the entrance 
keeping them secure i have never heard of any other instance of
table-land in a formation of quartz and which in the hill i examined 
had neither cleavage nor stratification i was told that the rock of
the corral was white and would strike fire 

we did not reach the posta on the rio tapalguen till after it was dark 
at supper from something which was said i was suddenly struck with
horror at thinking that i was eating one of the favourite dishes of the
country namely a half-formed calf long before its proper time of
birth it turned out to be puma the meat is very white and remarkably
like veal in taste dr shaw was laughed at for stating that the
flesh of the lion is in great esteem having no small affinity with
veal both in colour taste and flavour such certainly is the case
with the puma the gauchos differ in their opinion whether the jaguar
is good eating but are unanimous in saying that cat is excellent 

september th we followed the course of the rio tapalguen through a
very fertile country to the ninth posta tapalguen itself or the
town of tapalguen if it may be so called consists of a perfectly
level plain studded over as far as the eye can reach with the toldos
or oven-shaped huts of the indians the families of the friendly
indians who were fighting on the side of rosas resided here we met
and passed many young indian women riding by two or three together on
the same horse they as well as many of the young men were strikingly
handsome their fine ruddy complexions being the picture of health 
besides the toldos there were three ranchos one inhabited by the
commandant and the two others by spaniards with small shops 

we were here able to buy some biscuit i had now been several days
without tasting anything besides meat i did not at all dislike this
new regimen but i felt as if it would only have agreed with me with
hard exercise i have heard that patients in england when desired to
confine themselves exclusively to an animal diet even with the hope of
life before their eyes have hardly been able to endure it yet the
gaucho in the pampas for months together touches nothing but beef 
but they eat i observe a very large proportion of fat which is of a
less animalized nature and they particularly dislike dry meat such as
that of the agouti dr richardson also has remarked that when
people have fed for a long time solely upon lean animal food the
desire for fat becomes so insatiable that they can consume a large
quantity of unmixed and even oily fat without nausea this appears to
me a curious physiological fact it is perhaps from their meat
regimen that the gauchos like other carnivorous animals can abstain
long from food i was told that at tandeel some troops voluntarily
pursued a party of indians for three days without eating or drinking 

we saw in the shops many articles such as horsecloths belts and
garters woven by the indian women the patterns were very pretty and
the colours brilliant the workmanship of the garters was so good that
an english merchant at buenos ayres maintained they must have been
manufactured in england till he found the tassels had been fastened by
split sinew 

september th we had a very long ride this day at the twelfth
posta which is seven leagues south of the rio salado we came to the
first estancia with cattle and white women afterwards we had to ride
for many miles through a country flooded with water above our horses 
knees by crossing the stirrups and riding arab-like with our legs
bent up we contrived to keep tolerably dry it was nearly dark when
we arrived at the salado the stream was deep and about forty yards
wide in summer however its bed becomes almost dry and the little
remaining water nearly as salt as that of the sea we slept at one of
the great estancias of general rosas it was fortified and of such an
extent that arriving in the dark i thought it was a town and fortress 
in the morning we saw immense herds of cattle the general here having
seventy-four square leagues of land formerly nearly three hundred men
were employed about this estate and they defied all the attacks of the
indians 

september th passed the guardia del monte this is a nice
scattered little town with many gardens full of peach and quince
trees the plain here looked like that around buenos ayres the turf
being short and bright green with beds of clover and thistles and
with bizcacha holes i was very much struck with the marked change in
the aspect of the country after having crossed the salado from a
coarse herbage we passed on to a carpet of fine green verdure i at
first attributed this to some change in the nature of the soil but the
inhabitants assured me that here as well as in banda oriental where
there is as great a difference between the country round monte video
and the thinly-inhabited savannahs of colonia the whole was to be
attributed to the manuring and grazing of the cattle exactly the same
fact has been observed in the prairies of north america where
coarse grass between five and six feet high when grazed by cattle 
changes into common pasture land i am not botanist enough to say
whether the change here is owing to the introduction of new species to
the altered growth of the same or to a difference in their
proportional numbers azara has also observed with astonishment this
change he is likewise much perplexed by the immediate appearance of
plants not occurring in the neighbourhood on the borders of any track
that leads to a newly-constructed hovel in another part he says 
 ces chevaux sauvages ont la manie de preferer les chemins et le
bord des routes pour deposer leurs excremens dont on trouve des
monceaux dans ces endroits does this not partly explain the
circumstance we thus have lines of richly manured land serving as
channels of communication across wide districts 

near the guardia we find the southern limit of two european plants now
become extraordinarily common the fennel in great profusion covers
the ditch-banks in the neighbourhood of buenos ayres monte video and
other towns but the cardoon cynara cardunculus has a far wider
range it occurs in these latitudes on both sides of the 
cordillera across the continent i saw it in unfrequented spots in
chile entre rios and banda oriental in the latter country alone 
very many probably several hundred square miles are covered by one
mass of these prickly plants and are impenetrable by man or beast 
over the undulating plains where these great beds occur nothing else
can now live before their introduction however the surface must
have supported as in other parts a rank herbage i doubt whether any
case is on record of an invasion on so grand a scale of one plant over
the aborigines as i have already said i nowhere saw the cardoon
south of the salado but it is probable that in proportion as that
country becomes inhabited the cardoon will extend its limits the
case is different with the giant thistle with variegated leaves of
the pampas for i met with it in the valley of the sauce according to
the principles so well laid down by mr lyell few countries have
undergone more remarkable changes since the year when the first
colonist of la plata landed with seventy-two horses the countless
herds of horses cattle and sheep not only have altered the whole
aspect of the vegetation but they have almost banished the guanaco 
deer and ostrich numberless other changes must likewise have taken
place the wild pig in some parts probably replaces the peccari packs
of wild dogs may be heard howling on the wooded banks of the
less-frequented streams and the common cat altered into a large and
fierce animal inhabits rocky hills as m d orbigny has remarked the
increase in numbers of the carrion-vulture since the introduction of
the domestic animals must have been infinitely great and we have
given reasons for believing that they have extended their southern
range no doubt many plants besides the cardoon and fennel are
naturalized thus the islands near the mouth of the parana are thickly
clothed with peach and orange trees springing from seeds carried there
by the waters of the river 

while changing horses at the guardia several people questioned us much
about the army i never saw anything like the enthusiasm for rosas 
and for the success of the most just of all wars because against
barbarians this expression it must be confessed is very natural 
for till lately neither man woman nor horse was safe from the
attacks of the indians we had a long day s ride over the same rich
green plain abounding with various flocks and with here and there a
solitary estancia and its one ombu tree in the evening it rained
heavily on arriving at a posthouse we were told by the owner that if
we had not a regular passport we must pass on for there were so many
robbers he would trust no one when he read however my passport 
which began with el naturalista don carlos his respect and civility
were as unbounded as his suspicions had been before what a naturalist
might be neither he nor his countrymen i suspect had any idea but
probably my title lost nothing of its value from that cause 

september th we arrived by the middle of the day at buenos ayres 
the outskirts of the city looked quite pretty with the agave hedges 
and groves of olive peach and willow trees all just throwing out
their fresh green leaves i rode to the house of mr lumb an english
merchant to whose kindness and hospitality during my stay in the
country i was greatly indebted 

the city of buenos ayres is large and i should think one of the
most regular in the world every street is at right angles to the one
it crosses and the parallel ones being equidistant the houses are
collected into solid squares of equal dimensions which are called
quadras on the other hand the houses themselves are hollow squares 
all the rooms opening into a neat little courtyard they are generally
only one story high with flat roofs which are fitted with seats and
are much frequented by the inhabitants in summer in the centre of the
town is the plaza where the public offices fortress cathedral etc 
stand here also the old viceroys before the revolution had their
palaces the general assemblage of buildings possesses considerable
architectural beauty although none individually can boast of any 

the great corral where the animals are kept for slaughter to supply
food to this beef-eating population is one of the spectacles best
worth seeing the strength of the horse as compared to that of the
bullock is quite astonishing a man on horseback having thrown his lazo
round the horns of a beast can drag it anywhere he chooses the
animal ploughing up the ground with outstretched legs in vain efforts
to resist the force generally dashes at full speed to one side but
the horse immediately turning to receive the shock stands so firmly
that the bullock is almost thrown down and it is surprising that their
necks are not broken the struggle is not however one of fair
strength the horse s girth being matched against the bullock s
extended neck in a similar manner a man can hold the wildest horse 
if caught with the lazo just behind the ears when the bullock has
been dragged to the spot where it is to be slaughtered the matador
with great caution cuts the hamstrings then is given the death bellow 
a noise more expressive of fierce agony than any i know i have often
distinguished it from a long distance and have always known that the
struggle was then drawing to a close the whole sight is horrible and
revolting the ground is almost made of bones and the horses and
riders are drenched with gore

september th in the evening i set out on an excursion to st fe 
which is situated nearly three hundred english miles from buenos ayres 
on the banks of the parana the roads in the neighbourhood of the city
after the rainy weather were extraordinarily bad i should never have
thought it possible for a bullock waggon to have crawled along as it
was they scarcely went at the rate of a mile an hour and a man was
kept ahead to survey the best line for making the attempt the
bullocks were terribly jaded it is a great mistake to suppose that
with improved roads and an accelerated rate of travelling the
sufferings of the animals increase in the same proportion we passed a
train of waggons and a troop of beasts on their road to mendoza the
distance is about geographical miles and the journey is generally
performed in fifty days these waggons are very long narrow and
thatched with reeds they have only two wheels the diameter of which
in some cases is as much as ten feet each is drawn by six bullocks 
which are urged on by a goad at least twenty feet long this is
suspended from within the roof for the wheel bullocks a smaller one is
kept and for the intermediate pair a point projects at right angles
from the middle of the long one 

the whole apparatus looked like some implement of war 

september th we passed the small town of luxan where there is a
wooden bridge over the river a most unusual convenience in this
country we passed also areco the plains appeared level but were not
so in fact for in various places the horizon was distant the
estancias are here wide apart for there is little good pasture owing
to the land being covered by beds either of an acrid clover or of the
great thistle the latter well known from the animated description
given by sir f head were at this time of the year two-thirds grown 
in some parts they were as high as the horse s back but in others they
had not yet sprung up and the ground was bare and dusty as on a
turnpike-road the clumps were of the most brilliant green and they
made a pleasing miniature-likeness of broken forest land when the
thistles are full grown the great beds are impenetrable except by a
few tracts as intricate as those in a labyrinth these are only known
to the robbers who at this season inhabit them and sally forth at
night to rob and cut throats with impunity upon asking at a house
whether robbers were numerous i was answered the thistles are not up
yet the meaning of which reply was not at first very obvious there
is little interest in passing over these tracts for they are inhabited
by few animals or birds excepting the bizcacha and its friend the
little owl 

the bizcacha is well known to form a prominent feature in the
zoology of the pampas it is found as far south as the rio negro in
lat degs but not beyond it cannot like the agouti subsist on
the gravelly and desert plains of patagonia but prefers a clayey or
sandy soil which produces a different and more abundant vegetation 
near mendoza at the foot of the cordillera it occurs in close
neighbourhood with the allied alpine species it is a very curious
circumstance in its geographical distribution that it has never been
seen fortunately for the inhabitants of banda oriental to the
eastward of the river uruguay yet in this province there are plains
which appear admirably adapted to its habits the uruguay has formed an
insuperable obstacle to its migration although the broader barrier of
the parana has been passed and the bizcacha is common in entre rios 
the province between these two great rivers near buenos ayres these
animals are exceedingly common their most favourite resort appears to
be those parts of the plain which during one-half of the year are
covered with giant thistles to the exclusion of other plants the
gauchos affirm that it lives on roots which from the great strength
of its gnawing teeth and the kind of places frequented by it seems
probable in the evening the bizcachas come out in numbers and quietly
sit at the mouths of their burrows on their haunches at such times
they are very tame and a man on horseback passing by seems only to
present an object for their grave contemplation they run very
awkwardly and when running out of danger from their elevated tails
and short front legs much resemble great rats their flesh when
cooked is very white and good but it is seldom used 

the bizcacha has one very singular habit namely dragging every hard
object to the mouth of its burrow around each group of holes many
bones of cattle stones thistle-stalks hard lumps of earth dry dung 
etc are collected into an irregular heap which frequently amounts to
as much as a wheelbarrow would contain i was credibly informed that a
gentleman when riding on a dark night dropped his watch he returned
in the morning and by searching the neighbourhood of every bizcacha
hole on the line of road as he expected he soon found it this habit
of picking up whatever may be lying on the ground anywhere near its
habitation must cost much trouble for what purpose it is done i am
quite unable to form even the most remote conjecture it cannot be for
defence because the rubbish is chiefly placed above the mouth of the
burrow which enters the ground at a very small inclination no doubt
there must exist some good reason but the inhabitants of the country
are quite ignorant of it the only fact which i know analogous to it 
is the habit of that extraordinary australian bird the calodera
maculata which makes an elegant vaulted passage of twigs for playing
in and which collects near the spot land and sea-shells bones and
the feathers of birds especially brightly coloured ones mr gould 
who has described these facts informs me that the natives when they
lose any hard object search the playing passages and he has known a
tobacco-pipe thus recovered 

the little owl athene cunicularia which has been so often mentioned 
on the plains of buenos ayres exclusively inhabits the holes of the
bizcacha but in banda oriental it is its own workman during the open
day but more especially in the evening these birds may be seen in
every direction standing frequently by pairs on the hillock near their
burrows if disturbed they either enter the hole or uttering a
shrill harsh cry move with a remarkably undulatory flight to a short
distance and then turning round steadily gaze at their pursuer 
occasionally in the evening they may be heard hooting i found in the
stomachs of two which i opened the remains of mice and i one day saw a
small snake killed and carried away it is said that snakes are their
common prey during the daytime i may here mention as showing on what
various kinds of food owls subsist that a species killed among the
islets of the chonos archipelago had its stomach full of good-sized
crabs in india there is a fishing genus of owls which likewise
catches crabs 

in the evening we crossed the rio arrecife on a simple raft made of
barrels lashed together and slept at the post-house on the other side 
i this day paid horse-hire for thirty-one leagues and although the sun
was glaring hot i was but little fatigued when captain head talks of
riding fifty leagues a day i do not imagine the distance is equal to
 english miles at all events the thirty-one leagues was only 
miles in a straight line and in an open country i should think four
additional miles for turnings would be a sufficient allowance 

th and th we continued to ride over plains of the same character 
at san nicolas i first saw the noble river of the parana at the foot
of the cliff on which the town stands some large vessels were at
anchor before arriving at rozario we crossed the saladillo a stream
of fine clear running water but too saline to drink rozario is a
large town built on a dead level plain which forms a cliff about sixty
feet high over the parana the river here is very broad with many
islands which are low and wooded as is also the opposite shore the
view would resemble that of a great lake if it were not for the
linear-shaped islets which alone give the idea of running water the
cliffs are the most picturesque part sometimes they are absolutely
perpendicular and of a red colour at other times in large broken
masses covered with cacti and mimosa-trees the real grandeur 
however of an immense river like this is derived from reflecting how
important a means of communication and commerce it forms between one
nation and another to what a distance it travels and from how vast a
territory it drains the great body of fresh water which flows past your
feet 

for many leagues north and south of san nicolas and rozario the
country is really level scarcely anything which travellers have
written about its extreme flatness can be considered as exaggeration 
yet i could never find a spot where by slowly turning round objects
were not seen at greater distances in some directions than in others 
and this manifestly proves inequality in the plain at sea a person s
eye being six feet above the surface of the water his horizon is two
miles and four-fifths distant in like manner the more level the
plain the more nearly does the horizon approach within these narrow
limits and this in my opinion entirely destroys that grandeur which
one would have imagined that a vast level plain would have possessed 

october st we started by moonlight and arrived at the rio tercero by
sunrise the river is also called the saladillo and it deserves the
name for the water is brackish i stayed here the greater part of the
day searching for fossil bones besides a perfect tooth of the
toxodon and many scattered bones i found two immense skeletons near
each other projecting in bold relief from the perpendicular cliff of
the parana they were however so completely decayed that i could
only bring away small fragments of one of the great molar teeth but
these are sufficient to show that the remains belonged to a mastodon 
probably to the same species with that which formerly must have
inhabited the cordillera in upper peru in such great numbers the men
who took me in the canoe said they had long known of these skeletons 
and had often wondered how they had got there the necessity of a
theory being felt they came to the conclusion that like the bizcacha 
the mastodon was formerly a burrowing animal in the evening we rode
another stage and crossed the monge another brackish stream bearing
the dregs of the washings of the pampas 

october nd we passed through corunda which from the luxuriance of
its gardens was one of the prettiest villages i saw from this point
to st fe the road is not very safe the western side of the parana
northward ceases to be inhabited and hence the indians sometimes come
down thus far and waylay travellers the nature of the country also
favours this for instead of a grassy plain there is an open woodland 
composed of low prickly mimosas we passed some houses that had been
ransacked and since deserted we saw also a spectacle which my guides
viewed with high satisfaction it was the skeleton of an indian with
the dried skin hanging on the bones suspended to the branch of a tree 

in the morning we arrived at st fe i was surprised to observe how
great a change of climate a difference of only three degrees of
latitude between this place and buenos ayres had caused this was
evident from the dress and complexion of the men from the increased
size of the ombu-trees the number of new cacti and other plants and
especially from the birds in the course of an hour i remarked
half-a-dozen birds which i had never seen at buenos ayres considering
that there is no natural boundary between the two places and that the
character of the country is nearly similar the difference was much
greater than i should have expected 

october rd and th i was confined for these two days to my bed by a
headache a good-natured old woman who attended me wished me to try
many odd remedies a common practice is to bind an orange-leaf or a
bit of black plaster to each temple and a still more general plan is 
to split a bean into halves moisten them and place one on each
temple where they will easily adhere it is not thought proper ever
to remove the beans or plaster but to allow them to drop off and
sometimes if a man with patches on his head is asked what is the
matter he will answer i had a headache the day before yesterday 
many of the remedies used by the people of the country are ludicrously
strange but too disgusting to be mentioned one of the least nasty is
to kill and cut open two puppies and bind them on each side of a broken
limb little hairless dogs are in great request to sleep at the feet
of invalids 

st fe is a quiet little town and is kept clean and in good order the
governor lopez was a common soldier at the time of the revolution 
but has now been seventeen years in power this stability of
government is owing to his tyrannical habits for tyranny seems as yet
better adapted to these countries than republicanism the governor s
favourite occupation is hunting indians a short time since he
slaughtered forty-eight and sold the children at the rate of three or
four pounds apiece 

october th we crossed the parana to st fe bajada a town on the
opposite shore the passage took some hours as the river here
consisted of a labyrinth of small streams separated by low wooded
islands i had a letter of introduction to an old catalonian spaniard 
who treated me with the most uncommon hospitality the bajada is the
capital of entre rios in the town contained inhabitants 
and the province yet few as the inhabitants are no province
has suffered more from bloody and desperate revolutions they boast
here of representatives ministers a standing army and governors so
it is no wonder that they have their revolutions at some future day
this must be one of the richest countries of la plata the soil is
varied and productive and its almost insular form gives it two grand
lines of communication by the rivers parana and uruguay 


i was delayed here five days and employed myself in examining the
geology of the surrounding country which was very interesting we
here see at the bottom of the cliffs beds containing sharks teeth and
sea-shells of extinct species passing above into an indurated marl 
and from that into the red clayey earth of the pampas with its
calcareous concretions and the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds this
vertical section clearly tells us of a large bay of pure salt-water 
gradually encroached on and at last converted into the bed of a muddy
estuary into which floating carcasses were swept at punta gorda in
banda oriental i found an alternation of the pampaean estuary deposit 
with a limestone containing some of the same extinct sea-shells and
this shows either a change in the former currents or more probably an
oscillation of level in the bottom of the ancient estuary until
lately my reasons for considering the pampaean formation to be an
estuary deposit were its general appearance its position at the mouth
of the existing great river the plata and the presence of so many
bones of terrestrial quadrupeds but now professor ehrenberg has had
the kindness to examine for me a little of the red earth taken from
low down in the deposit close to the skeletons of the mastodon and he
finds in it many infusoria partly salt-water and partly fresh-water
forms with the latter rather preponderating and therefore as he
remarks the water must have been brackish m a d orbigny found on
the banks of the parana at the height of a hundred feet great beds of
an estuary shell now living a hundred miles lower down nearer the sea 
and i found similar shells at a less height on the banks of the
uruguay this shows that just before the pampas was slowly elevated
into dry land the water covering it was brackish below buenos ayres
there are upraised beds of sea-shells of existing species which also
proves that the period of elevation of the pampas was within the recent
period 

in the pampaean deposit at the bajada i found the osseous armour of a
gigantic armadillo-like animal the inside of which when the earth was
removed was like a great cauldron i found also teeth of the toxodon
and mastodon and one tooth of a horse in the same stained and decayed
state this latter tooth greatly interested me and i took
scrupulous care in ascertaining that it had been embedded
contemporaneously with the other remains for i was not then aware that
amongst the fossils from bahia blanca there was a horse s tooth hidden
in the matrix nor was it then known with certainty that the remains of
horses are common in north america mr lyell has lately brought from
the united states a tooth of a horse and it is an interesting fact 
that professor owen could find in no species either fossil or recent 
a slight but peculiar curvature characterizing it until he thought of
comparing it with my specimen found here he has named this american
horse equus curvidens certainly it is a marvellous fact in the
history of the mammalia that in south america a native horse should
have lived and disappeared to be succeeded in after-ages by the
countless herds descended from the few introduced with the spanish
colonists 

the existence in south america of a fossil horse of the mastodon 
possibly of an elephant and of a hollow-horned ruminant 
discovered by mm lund and clausen in the caves of brazil are highly
interesting facts with respect to the geographical distribution of
animals at the present time if we divide america not by the isthmus
of panama but by the southern part of mexico in lat degs 
where the great table-land presents an obstacle to the migration of
species by affecting the climate and by forming with the exception
of some valleys and of a fringe of low land on the coast a broad
barrier we shall then have the two zoological provinces of north and
south america strongly contrasted with each other some few species
alone have passed the barrier and may be considered as wanderers from
the south such as the puma opossum kinkajou and peccari south
america is characterized by possessing many peculiar gnawers a family
of monkeys the llama peccari tapir opossums and especially 
several genera of edentata the order which includes the sloths 
ant-eaters and armadilloes north america on the other hand is
characterized putting on one side a few wandering species by numerous
peculiar gnawers and by four genera the ox sheep goat and
antelope of hollow-horned ruminants of which great division south
america is not known to possess a single species formerly but within
the period when most of the now existing shells were living north
america possessed besides hollow-horned ruminants the elephant 
mastodon horse and three genera of edentata namely the megatherium 
megalonyx and mylodon within nearly this same period as proved by
the shells at bahia blanca south america possessed as we have just
seen a mastodon horse hollow-horned ruminant and the same three
genera as well as several others of the edentata hence it is
evident that north and south america in having within a late
geological period these several genera in common were much more
closely related in the character of their terrestrial inhabitants than
they now are the more i reflect on this case the more interesting it
appears i know of no other instance where we can almost mark the
period and manner of the splitting up of one great region into two
well-characterized zoological provinces the geologist who is fully
impressed with the vast oscillations of level which have affected the
earth s crust within late periods will not fear to speculate on the
recent elevation of the mexican platform or more probably on the
recent submergence of land in the west indian archipelago as the cause
of the present zoological separation of north and south america the
south american character of the west indian mammals seems to
indicate that this archipelago was formerly united to the southern
continent and that it has subsequently been an area of subsidence 

when america and especially north america possessed its elephants 
mastodons horse and hollow-horned ruminants it was much more closely
related in its zoological characters to the temperate parts of europe
and asia than it now is as the remains of these genera are found on
both sides of behring s straits and on the plains of siberia we
are led to look to the north-western side of north america as the
former point of communication between the old and so-called new world 
and as so many species both living and extinct of these same genera
inhabit and have inhabited the old world it seems most probable that
the north american elephants mastodons horse and hollow-horned
ruminants migrated on land since submerged near behring s straits 
from siberia into north america and thence on land since submerged in
the west indies into south america where for a time they mingled with
the forms characteristic of that southern continent and have since
become extinct 


while travelling through the country i received several vivid
descriptions of the effects of a late great drought and the account of
this may throw some light on the cases where vast numbers of animals of
all kinds have been embedded together the period included between the
years and is called the gran seco or the great drought 
during this time so little rain fell that the vegetation even to the
thistles failed the brooks were dried up and the whole country
assumed the appearance of a dusty high road this was especially the
case in the northern part of the province of buenos ayres and the
southern part of st fe very great numbers of birds wild animals 
cattle and horses perished from the want of food and water a man
told me that the deer used to come into his courtyard to the well 
which he had been obliged to dig to supply his own family with water 
and that the partridges had hardly strength to fly away when pursued 
the lowest estimation of the loss of cattle in the province of buenos
ayres alone was taken at one million head a proprietor at san pedro
had previously to these years cattle at the end not one
remained san pedro is situated in the middle of the finest country 
and even now abounds again with animals yet during the latter part of
the gran seco live cattle were brought in vessels for the
consumption of the inhabitants the animals roamed from their
estancias and wandering far southward were mingled together in such
multitudes that a government commission was sent from buenos ayres to
settle the disputes of the owners sir woodbine parish informed me of
another and very curious source of dispute the ground being so long
dry such quantities of dust were blown about that in this open
country the landmarks became obliterated and people could not tell the
limits of their estates 

i was informed by an eye-witness that the cattle in herds of thousands
rushed into the parana and being exhausted by hunger they were unable
to crawl up the muddy banks and thus were drowned the arm of the
river which runs by san pedro was so full of putrid carcasses that the
master of a vessel told me that the smell rendered it quite impassable 
without doubt several hundred thousand animals thus perished in the
river their bodies when putrid were seen floating down the stream and
many in all probability were deposited in the estuary of the plata all
the small rivers became highly saline and this caused the death of
vast numbers in particular spots for when an animal drinks of such
water it does not recover azara describes the fury of the wild
horses on a similar occasion rushing into the marshes those which
arrived first being overwhelmed and crushed by those which followed he
adds that more than once he has seen the carcasses of upwards of a
thousand wild horses thus destroyed i noticed that the smaller
streams in the pampas were paved with a breccia of bones but this
probably is the effect of a gradual increase rather than of the
destruction at any one period subsequently to the drought of to
 a very rainy season followed which caused great floods hence it
is almost certain that some thousands of the skeletons were buried by
the deposits of the very next year what would be the opinion of a
geologist viewing such an enormous collection of bones of all kinds
of animals and of all ages thus embedded in one thick earthy mass 
would he not attribute it to a flood having swept over the surface of
the land rather than to the common order of things 

october th i had intended to push my excursion further but not
being quite well i was compelled to return by a balandra or
one-masted vessel of about a hundred tons burden which was bound to
buenos ayres as the weather was not fair we moored early in the day
to a branch of a tree on one of the islands the parana is full of
islands which undergo a constant round of decay and renovation in the
memory of the master several large ones had disappeared and others
again had been formed and protected by vegetation they are composed
of muddy sand without even the smallest pebble and were then about
four feet above the level of the river but during the periodical
floods they are inundated they all present one character numerous
willows and a few other trees are bound together by a great variety of
creeping plants thus forming a thick jungle these thickets afford a
retreat for capybaras and jaguars the fear of the latter animal quite
destroyed all pleasure in scrambling through the woods this evening i
had not proceeded a hundred yards before finding indubitable signs of
the recent presence of the tiger i was obliged to come back on every
island there were tracks and as on the former excursion el rastro de
los indios had been the subject of conversation so in this was el
rastro del tigre the wooded banks of the great rivers appear to be
the favourite haunts of the jaguar but south of the plata i was told
that they frequented the reeds bordering lakes wherever they are they
seem to require water their common prey is the capybara so that it
is generally said where capybaras are numerous there is little danger
from the jaguar falconer states that near the southern side of the
mouth of the plata there are many jaguars and that they chiefly live
on fish this account i have heard repeated on the parana they have
killed many wood-cutters and have even entered vessels at night there
is a man now living in the bajada who coming up from below when it
was dark was seized on the deck he escaped however with the loss of
the use of one arm when the floods drive these animals from the
islands they are most dangerous i was told that a few years since a
very large one found its way into a church at st fe two padres
entering one after the other were killed and a third who came to see
what was the matter escaped with difficulty the beast was destroyed
by being shot from a corner of the building which was unroofed they
commit also at these times great ravages among cattle and horses it
is said that they kill their prey by breaking their necks if driven
from the carcass they seldom return to it the gauchos say that the
jaguar when wandering about at night is much tormented by the foxes
yelping as they follow him this is a curious coincidence with the
fact which is generally affirmed of the jackals accompanying in a
similarly officious manner the east indian tiger the jaguar is a
noisy animal roaring much by night and especially before bad weather 

one day when hunting on the banks of the uruguay i was shown certain
trees to which these animals constantly recur for the purpose as it
is said of sharpening their claws i saw three well-known trees in
front the bark was worn smooth as if by the breast of the animal and
on each side there were deep scratches or rather grooves extending in
an oblique line nearly a yard in length the scars were of different
ages a common method of ascertaining whether a jaguar is in the
neighbourhood is to examine these trees i imagine this habit of the
jaguar is exactly similar to one which may any day be seen in the
common cat as with outstretched legs and exserted claws it scrapes the
leg of a chair and i have heard of young fruit-trees in an orchard in
england having been thus much injured some such habit must also be
common to the puma for on the bare hard soil of patagonia i have
frequently seen scores so deep that no other animal could have made
them the object of this practice is i believe to tear off the
ragged points of their claws and not as the gauchos think to sharpen
them the jaguar is killed without much difficulty by the aid of
dogs baying and driving him up a tree where he is despatched with
bullets 

owing to bad weather we remained two days at our moorings our only
amusement was catching fish for our dinner there were several kinds 
and all good eating a fish called the armado a silurus is
remarkable from a harsh grating noise which it makes when caught by
hook and line and which can be distinctly heard when the fish is
beneath the water this same fish has the power of firmly catching
hold of any object such as the blade of an oar or the fishing-line 
with the strong spine both of its pectoral and dorsal fin in the
evening the weather was quite tropical the thermometer standing at 
degs numbers of fireflies were hovering about and the musquitoes
were very troublesome i exposed my hand for five minutes and it was
soon black with them i do not suppose there could have been less than
fifty all busy sucking 

october th we got under way and passed punta gorda where there is
a colony of tame indians from the province of missiones we sailed
rapidly down the current but before sunset from a silly fear of bad
weather we brought-to in a narrow arm of the river i took the boat
and rowed some distance up this creek it was very narrow winding 
and deep on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high formed by
trees intwined with creepers gave to the canal a singularly gloomy
appearance i here saw a very extraordinary bird called the
scissor-beak rhynchops nigra it has short legs web feet extremely
long-pointed wings and is of about the size of a tern the beak is
flattened laterally that is in a plane at right angles to that of a
spoonbill or duck it is as flat and elastic as an ivory paper-cutter 
and the lower mandible differing from every other bird is an inch and
a half longer than the upper in a lake near maldonado from which the
water had been nearly drained and which in consequence swarmed with
small fry i saw several of these birds generally in small flocks 
flying rapidly backwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake 
they kept their bills wide open and the lower mandible half buried in
the water thus skimming the surface they ploughed it in their
course the water was quite smooth and it formed a most curious
spectacle to behold a flock each bird leaving its narrow wake on the
mirror-like surface in their flight they frequently twist about with
extreme quickness and dexterously manage with their projecting lower
mandible to plough up small fish which are secured by the upper and
shorter half of their scissor-like

 picture 

bills this fact i repeatedly saw as like swallows they continued
to fly backwards and forwards close before me occasionally when
leaving the surface of the water their flight was wild irregular and
rapid they then uttered loud harsh cries when these birds are
fishing the advantage of the long primary feathers of their wings in
keeping them dry is very evident when thus employed their forms
resemble the symbol by which many artists represent marine birds their
tails are much used in steering their irregular course 

these birds are common far inland along the course of the rio parana 
it is said that they remain here during the whole year and breed in
the marshes during the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains
at some distance from the water being at anchor as i have said in
one of the deep creeks between the islands of the parana as the
evening drew to a close one of these scissor-beaks suddenly appeared 
the water was quite still and many little fish were rising the bird
continued for a long time to skim the surface flying in its wild and
irregular manner up and down the narrow canal now dark with the
growing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees at monte
video i observed that some large flocks during the day remained on the
mud-banks at the head of the harbour in the same manner as on the
grassy plains near the parana and every evening they took flight
seaward from these facts i suspect that the rhynchops generally
fishes by night at which time many of the lower animals come most
abundantly to the surface m lesson states that he has seen these
birds opening the shells of the mactrae buried in the sand-banks on the
coast of chile from their weak bills with the lower mandible so much
projecting their short legs and long wings it is very improbable that
this can be a general habit 

in our course down the parana i observed only three other birds whose
habits are worth mentioning one is a small kingfisher ceryle
americana it has a longer tail than the european species and hence
does not sit in so stiff and upright a position its flight also 
instead of being direct and rapid like the course of an arrow is weak
and undulatory as among the soft-billed birds it utters a low note 
like the clicking together of two small stones a small green parrot
 conurus murinus with a grey breast appears to prefer the tall trees
on the islands to any other situation for its building-place a number
of nests are placed so close together as to form one great mass of
sticks these parrots always live in flocks and commit great ravages
on the corn-fields i was told that near colonia were killed in
the course of one year a bird with a forked tail terminated by two
long feathers tyrannus savana and named by the spaniards
scissor-tail is very common near buenos ayres it commonly sits on a
branch of the ombu tree near a house and thence takes a short
flight in pursuit of insects and returns to the same spot when on
the wing it presents in its manner of flight and general appearance a
caricature-likeness of the common swallow it has the power of turning
very shortly in the air and in so doing opens and shuts its tail 
sometimes in a horizontal or lateral and sometimes in a vertical
direction just like a pair of scissors 

october th some leagues below rozario the western shore of the
parana is bounded by perpendicular cliffs which extend in a long line
to below san nicolas hence it more resembles a sea-coast than that of
a fresh-water river it is a great drawback to the scenery of the
parana that from the soft nature of its banks the water is very
muddy the uruguay flowing through a granitic country is much
clearer and where the two channels unite at the head of the plata the
waters may for a long distance be distinguished by their black and red
colours in the evening the wind being not quite fair as usual we
immediately moored and the next day as it blew rather freshly though
with a favouring current the master was much too indolent to think of
starting at bajada he was described to me as hombre muy aflicto a
man always miserable to get on but certainly he bore all delays with
admirable resignation he was an old spaniard and had been many years
in this country he professed a great liking to the english but
stoutly maintained that the battle of trafalgar was merely won by the
spanish captains having been all bought over and that the only really
gallant action on either side was performed by the spanish admiral it
struck me as rather characteristic that this man should prefer his
countrymen being thought the worst of traitors rather than unskilful
or cowardly 

th and th we continued slowly to sail down the noble stream the
current helped us but little we met during our descent very few
vessels one of the best gifts of nature in so grand a channel of
communication seems here wilfully thrown away a river in which ships
might navigate from a temperate country as surprisingly abundant in
certain productions as destitute of others to another possessing a
tropical climate and a soil which according to the best of judges m 
bonpland is perhaps unequalled in fertility in any part of the world 
how different would have been the aspect of this river if english
colonists had by good fortune first sailed up the plata what noble
towns would now have occupied its shores till the death of francia 
the dictator of paraguay these two countries must remain distinct as
if placed on opposite sides of the globe and when the old
bloody-minded tyrant is gone to his long account paraguay will be torn
by revolutions violent in proportion to the previous unnatural calm 
that country will have to learn like every other south american state 
that a republic cannot succeed till it contains a certain body of men
imbued with the principles of justice and honour 

october th being arrived at the mouth of the parana and as i was
very anxious to reach buenos ayres i went on shore at las conchas 
with the intention of riding there upon landing i found to my great
surprise that i was to a certain degree a prisoner a violent
revolution having broken out all the ports were laid under an embargo 
i could not return to my vessel and as for going by land to the city 
it was out of the question after a long conversation with the
commandant i obtained permission to go the next day to general rolor 
who commanded a division of the rebels on this side the capital in
the morning i rode to the encampment the general officers and
soldiers all appeared and i believe really were great villains the
general the very evening before he left the city voluntarily went to
the governor and with his hand to his heart pledged his word of
honour that he at least would remain faithful to the last the general
told me that the city was in a state of close blockade and that all he
could do was to give me a passport to the commander-in-chief of the
rebels at quilmes we had therefore to take a great sweep round the
city and it was with much difficulty that we procured horses my
reception at the encampment was quite civil but i was told it was
impossible that i could be allowed to enter the city i was very
anxious about this as i anticipated the beagle s departure from the
rio plata earlier than it took place having mentioned however 
general rosas s obliging kindness to me when at the colorado magic
itself could not have altered circumstances quicker than did this
conversation i was instantly told that though they could not give me
a passport if i chose to leave my guide and horses i might pass their
sentinels i was too glad to accept of this and an officer was sent
with me to give directions that i should not be stopped at the bridge 
the road for the space of a league was quite deserted i met one party
of soldiers who were satisfied by gravely looking at an old passport 
and at length i was not a little pleased to find myself within the city 

this revolution was supported by scarcely any pretext of grievances 
but in a state which in the course of nine months from february to
october underwent fifteen changes in its government each
governor according to the constitution being elected for three
years it would be very unreasonable to ask for pretexts in this
case a party of men who being attached to rosas were disgusted with
the governor balcarce to the number of seventy left the city and with
the cry of rosas the whole country took arms the city was then
blockaded no provisions cattle or horses were allowed to enter 
besides this there was only a little skirmishing and a few men daily
killed the outside party well knew that by stopping the supply of
meat they would certainly be victorious general rosas could not have
known of this rising but it appears to be quite consonant with the
plans of his party a year ago he was elected governor but he refused
it unless the sala would also confer on him extraordinary powers this
was refused and since then his party have shown that no other governor
can keep his place the warfare on both sides was avowedly protracted
till it was possible to hear from rosas a note arrived a few days
after i left buenos ayres which stated that the general disapproved of
peace having been broken but that he thought the outside party had
justice on their side on the bare reception of this the governor 
ministers and part of the military to the number of some hundreds 
fled from the city the rebels entered elected a new governor and
were paid for their services to the number of men from these
proceedings it was clear that rosas ultimately would become the
dictator to the term king the people in this as in other republics 
have a particular dislike since leaving south america we have heard
that rosas has been elected with powers and for a time altogether
opposed to the constitutional principles of the republic 

 the bizcacha lagostomus trichodactylus somewhat resembles a large
rabbit but with bigger gnawing teeth and a long tail it has however 
only three toes behind like the agouti during the last three or four
years the skins of these animals have been sent to england for the sake
of the fur

having been delayed for nearly a fortnight in the city i was glad to
escape on board a packet bound for monte video a town in a state of
blockade must always be a disagreeable place of residence in this case
moreover there were constant apprehensions from robbers within the
sentinels were the worst of all for from their office and from having
arms in their hands they robbed with a degree of authority which other
men could not imitate 

our passage was a very long and tedious one the plata looks like a
noble estuary on the map but is in truth a poor affair a wide
expanse of muddy water has neither grandeur nor beauty at one time of
the day the two shores both of which are extremely low could just be
distinguished from the deck on arriving at monte video i found that
the beagle would not sail for some time so i prepared for a short
excursion in this part of banda oriental everything which i have said
about the country near maldonado is applicable to monte video but the
land with the one exception of the green mount feet high from
which it takes its name is far more level very little of the
undulating grassy plain is enclosed but near the town there are a few
hedge-banks covered with agaves cacti and fennel 

november th we left monte video in the afternoon i intended to
proceed to colonia del sacramiento situated on the northern bank of
the plata and opposite to buenos ayres and thence following up the
uruguay to the village of mercedes on the rio negro one of the many
rivers of this name in south america and from this point to return
direct to monte video we slept at the house of my guide at canelones 
in the morning we rose early in the hopes of being able to ride a good
distance but it was a vain attempt for all the rivers were flooded 
we passed in boats the streams of canelones st lucia and san jose 
and thus lost much time on a former excursion i crossed the lucia
near its mouth and i was surprised to observe how easily our horses 
although not used to swim passed over a width of at least six hundred
yards on mentioning this at monte video i was told that a vessel
containing some mountebanks and their horses being wrecked in the
plata one horse swam seven miles to the shore in the course of the
day i was amused by the dexterity with which a gaucho forced a restive
horse to swim a river he stripped off his clothes and jumping on its
back rode into the water till it was out of its depth then slipping
off over the crupper he caught hold of the tail and as often as the
horse turned round the man frightened it back by splashing water in its
face as soon as the horse touched the bottom on the other side the
man pulled himself on and was firmly seated bridle in hand before
the horse gained the bank a naked man on a naked horse is a fine
spectacle i had no idea how well the two animals suited each other 
the tail of a horse is a very useful appendage i have passed a river
in a boat with four people in it which was ferried across in the same
way as the gaucho if a man and horse have to cross a broad river the
best plan is for the man to catch hold of the pommel or mane and help
himself with the other arm 

we slept and stayed the following day at the post of cufre in the
evening the postman or letter-carrier arrived he was a day after his
time owing to the rio rozario being flooded it would not however 
be of much consequence for although he had passed through some of the
principal towns in banda oriental his luggage consisted of two
letters the view from the house was pleasing an undulating green
surface with distant glimpses of the plata i find that i look at
this province with very different eyes from what i did upon my first
arrival i recollect i then thought it singularly level but now 
after galloping over the pampas my only surprise is what could have
induced me ever to call it level the country is a series of
undulations in themselves perhaps not absolutely great but as
compared to the plains of st fe real mountains from these
inequalities there is an abundance of small rivulets and the turf is
green and luxuriant 

november th we crossed the rozario which was deep and rapid and
passing the village of colla arrived at midday at colonia del
sacramiento the distance is twenty leagues through a country covered
with fine grass but poorly stocked with cattle or inhabitants i was
invited to sleep at colonia and to accompany on the following day a
gentleman to his estancia where there were some limestone rocks the
town is built on a stony promontory something in the same manner as at
monte video it is strongly fortified but both fortifications and
town suffered much in the brazilian war it is very ancient and the
irregularity of the streets and the surrounding groves of old orange
and peach trees gave it a pretty appearance the church is a curious
ruin it was used as a powder-magazine and was struck by lightning in
one of the ten thousand thunderstorms of the rio plata two-thirds of
the building were blown away to the very foundation and the rest
stands a shattered and curious monument of the united powers of
lightning and gunpowder in the evening i wandered about the
half-demolished walls of the town it was the chief seat of the
brazilian war a war most injurious to this country not so much in
its immediate effects as in being the origin of a multitude of
generals and all other grades of officers more generals are numbered
 but not paid in the united provinces of la plata than in the united
kingdom of great britain these gentlemen have learned to like power 
and do not object to a little skirmishing hence there are many always
on the watch to create disturbance and to overturn a government which
as yet has never rested on any staple foundation i noticed however 
both here and in other places a very general interest in the ensuing
election for the president and this appears a good sign for the
prosperity of this little country the inhabitants do not require much
education in their representatives i heard some men discussing the
merits of those for colonia and it was said that although they were
not men of business they could all sign their names with this they
seemed to think every reasonable man ought to be satisfied 

th rode with my host to his estancia at the arroyo de san juan in
the evening we took a ride round the estate it contained two square
leagues and a half and was situated in what is called a rincon that
is one side was fronted by the plata and the two others guarded by
impassable brooks there was an excellent port for little vessels and
an abundance of small wood which is valuable as supplying fuel to
buenos ayres i was curious to know the value of so complete an
estancia of cattle there were and it would well support three
or four times that number of mares together with broken-in
horses and sheep there was plenty of water and limestone a
rough house excellent corrals and a peach orchard for all this he
had been offered pounds and he only wanted pounds additional 
and probably would sell it for less the chief trouble with an
estancia is driving the cattle twice a week to a central spot in order
to make them tame and to count them this latter operation would be
thought difficult where there are ten or fifteen thousand head
together it is managed on the principle that the cattle invariably
divide themselves into little troops of from forty to one hundred each
troop is recognized by a few peculiarly marked animals and its number
is known so that one being lost out of ten thousand it is perceived
by its absence from one of the tropillas during a stormy night the
cattle all mingle together but the next morning the tropillas separate
as before so that each animal must know its fellow out of ten thousand
others 

on two occasions i met with in this province some oxen of a very
curious breed called nata or niata they appear externally to hold
nearly the same relation to other cattle which bull or pug dogs do to
other dogs their forehead is very short and broad with the nasal end
turned up and the upper lip much drawn back their lower jaws project
beyond the upper and have a corresponding upward curve hence their
teeth are always exposed their nostrils are seated high up and are
very open their eyes project outwards when walking they carry their
heads low on a short neck and their hinder legs are rather longer
compared with the front legs than is usual their bare teeth their
short heads and upturned nostrils give them the most ludicrous
self-confident air of defiance imaginable 

since my return i have procured a skeleton head through the kindness
of my friend captain sulivan r n which is now deposited in the
college of surgeons don f muniz of luxan has kindly collected
for me all the information which he could respecting this breed from
his account it seems that about eighty or ninety years ago they were
rare and kept as curiosities at buenos ayres the breed is universally
believed to have originated amongst the indians southward of the plata 
and that it was with them the commonest kind even to this day those
reared in the provinces near the plata show their less civilized
origin in being fiercer than common cattle and in the cow easily
deserting her first calf if visited too often or molested it is a
singular fact that an almost similar structure to the abnormal one
of the niata breed characterizes as i am informed by dr falconer 
that great extinct ruminant of india the sivatherium the breed is
very true and a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves 
a niata bull with a common cow or the reverse cross produces
offspring having an intermediate character but with the niata
characters strongly displayed according to senor muniz there is the
clearest evidence contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in
analogous cases that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull
transmits her peculiarities more strongly than the niata bull when
crossed with a common cow when the pasture is tolerably long the
niata cattle feed with the tongue and palate as well as common cattle 
but during the great droughts when so many animals perish the niata
breed is under a great disadvantage and would be exterminated if not
attended to for the common cattle like horses are able just to keep
alive by browsing with their lips on twigs of trees and reeds this
the niatas cannot so well do as their lips do not join and hence they
are found to perish before the common cattle this strikes me as a
good illustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary
habits of life on what circumstances occurring only at long
intervals the rarity or extinction of a species may be determined 

november th passing the valley of las vacas we slept at a house of
a north american who worked a lime-kiln on the arroyo de las vivoras 
in the morning we rode to a protecting headland on the banks of the
river called punta gorda on the way we tried to find a jaguar there
were plenty of fresh tracks and we visited the trees on which they
are said to sharpen their claws but we did not succeed in disturbing
one from this point the rio uruguay presented to our view a noble
volume of water from the clearness and rapidity of the stream its
appearance was far superior to that of its neighbour the parana on
the opposite coast several branches from the latter river entered the
uruguay as the sun was shining the two colours of the waters could
be seen quite distinct 

in the evening we proceeded on our road towards mercedes on the rio
negro at night we asked permission to sleep at an estancia at which
we happened to arrive it was a very large estate being ten leagues
square and the owner is one of the greatest landowners in the country 
his nephew had charge of it and with him there was a captain in the
army who the other day ran away from buenos ayres considering their
station their conversation was rather amusing they expressed as was
usual unbounded astonishment at the globe being round and could
scarcely credit that a hole would if deep enough come out on the
other side they had however heard of a country where there were six
months of light and six of darkness and where the inhabitants were
very tall and thin they were curious about the price and condition of
horses and cattle in england upon finding out we did not catch our
animals with the lazo they cried out ah then you use nothing but
the bolas the idea of an enclosed country was quite new to them the
captain at last said he had one question to ask me which he should be
very much obliged if i would answer with all truth i trembled to
think how deeply scientific it would be it was whether the ladies of
buenos ayres were not the handsomest in the world i replied like a
renegade charmingly so he added i have one other question do
ladies in any other part of the world wear such large combs i
solemnly assured him that they did not they were absolutely
delighted the captain exclaimed look there a man who has seen half
the world says it is the case we always thought so but now we know
it my excellent judgment in combs and beauty procured me a most
hospitable reception the captain forced me to take his bed and he
would sleep on his recado 

st started at sunrise and rode slowly during the whole day the
geological nature of this part of the province was different from the
rest and closely resembled that of the pampas in consequence there
were immense beds of the thistle as well as of the cardoon the whole
country indeed may be called one great bed of these plants the two
sorts grow separate each plant in company with its own kind the
cardoon is as high as a horse s back but the pampas thistle is often
higher than the crown of the rider s head to leave the road for a
yard is out of the question and the road itself is partly and in some
cases entirely closed pasture of course there is none if cattle or
horses once enter the bed they are for the time completely lost hence
it is very hazardous to attempt to drive cattle at this season of the
year for when jaded enough to face the thistles they rush among them 
and are seen no more in these districts there are very few estancias 
and these few are situated in the neighbourhood of damp valleys where
fortunately neither of these overwhelming plants can exist as night
came on before we arrived at our journey s end we slept at a miserable
little hovel inhabited by the poorest people the extreme though
rather formal courtesy of our host and hostess considering their grade
of life was quite delightful 

november nd arrived at an estancia on the berquelo belonging to a
very hospitable englishman to whom i had a letter of introduction from
my friend mr lumb i stayed here three days one morning i rode with
my host to the sierra del pedro flaco about twenty miles up the rio
negro nearly the whole country was covered with good though coarse
grass which was as high as a horse s belly yet there were square
leagues without a single head of cattle the province of banda
oriental if well stocked would support an astonishing number of
animals at present the annual export of hides from monte video amounts
to three hundred thousand and the home consumption from waste is
very considerable an estanciero told me that he often had to send
large herds of cattle a long journey to a salting establishment and
that the tired beasts were frequently obliged to be killed and skinned 
but that he could never persuade the gauchos to eat of them and every
evening a fresh beast was slaughtered for their suppers the view of
the rio negro from the sierra was more picturesque than any other which
i saw in this province the river broad deep and rapid wound at
the foot of a rocky precipitous cliff a belt of wood followed its
course and the horizon terminated in the distant undulations of the
turf-plain 

when in this neighbourhood i several times heard of the sierra de las
cuentas a hill distant many miles to the northward the name
signifies hill of beads i was assured that vast numbers of little
round stones of various colours each with a small cylindrical hole 
are found there formerly the indians used to collect them for the
purpose of making necklaces and bracelets a taste i may observe 
which is common to all savage nations as well as to the most polished 
i did not know what to understand from this story but upon mentioning
it at the cape of good hope to dr andrew smith he told me that he
recollected finding on the south-eastern coast of africa about one
hundred miles to the eastward of st john s river some quartz
crystals with their edges blunted from attrition and mixed with gravel
on the sea-beach each crystal was about five lines in diameter and
from an inch to an inch and a half in length many of them had a small
canal extending from one extremity to the other perfectly cylindrical 
and of a size that readily admitted a coarse thread or a piece of fine
catgut their colour was red or dull white the natives were
acquainted with this structure in crystals i have mentioned these
circumstances because although no crystallized body is at present
known to assume this form it may lead some future traveller to
investigate the real nature of such stones 


while staying at this estancia i was amused with what i saw and heard
of the shepherd-dogs of the country when riding it is a common
thing to meet a large flock of sheep guarded by one or two dogs at the
distance of some miles from any house or man i often wondered how so
firm a friendship had been established the method of education
consists in separating the puppy while very young from the bitch and
in accustoming it to its future companions an ewe is held three or
four times a day for the little thing to suck and a nest of wool is
made for it in the sheep-pen at no time is it allowed to associate
with other dogs or with the children of the family the puppy is 
moreover generally castrated so that when grown up it can scarcely
have any feelings in common with the rest of its kind from this
education it has no wish to leave the flock and just as another dog
will defend its master man so will these the sheep it is amusing to
observe when approaching a flock how the dog immediately advances
barking and the sheep all close in his rear as if round the oldest
ram these dogs are also easily taught to bring home the flock at a
certain hour in the evening their most troublesome fault when young 
is their desire of playing with the sheep for in their sport they
sometimes gallop their poor subjects most unmercifully 

the shepherd-dog comes to the house every day for some meat and as
soon as it is given him he skulks away as if ashamed of himself on
these occasions the house-dogs are very tyrannical and the least of
them will attack and pursue the stranger the minute however the
latter has reached the flock he turns round and begins to bark and
then all the house-dogs take very quickly to their heels in a similar
manner a whole pack of the hungry wild dogs will scarcely ever and i
was told by some never venture to attack a flock guarded by even one
of these faithful shepherds the whole account appears to me a curious
instance of the pliability of the affections in the dog and yet 
whether wild or however educated he has a feeling of respect or fear
for those that are fulfilling their instinct of association for we
can understand on no principle the wild dogs being driven away by the
single one with its flock except that they consider from some
confused notion that the one thus associated gains power as if in
company with its own kind f cuvier has observed that all animals that
readily enter into domestication consider man as a member of their own
society and thus fulfil their instinct of association in the above
case the shepherd-dog ranks the sheep as its fellow-brethren and thus
gains confidence and the wild dogs though knowing that the individual
sheep are not dogs but are good to eat yet partly consent to this
view when seeing them in a flock with a shepherd-dog at their head 

one evening a domidor a subduer of horses came for the purpose of
breaking-in some colts i will describe the preparatory steps for i
believe they have not been mentioned by other travellers a troop of
wild young horses is driven into the corral or large enclosure of
stakes and the door is shut we will suppose that one man alone has
to catch and mount a horse which as yet had never felt bridle or
saddle i conceive except by a gaucho such a feat would be utterly
impracticable the gaucho picks out a full-grown colt and as the
beast rushes round the circus he throws his lazo so as to catch both
the front legs instantly the horse rolls over with a heavy shock and
whilst struggling on the ground the gaucho holding the lazo tight 
makes a circle so as to catch one of the hind legs just beneath the
fetlock and draws it close to the two front legs he then hitches the
lazo so that the three are bound together then sitting on the
horse s neck he fixes a strong bridle without a bit to the lower
jaw this he does by passing a narrow thong through the eye-holes at
the end of the reins and several times round both jaw and tongue the
two front legs are now tied closely together with a strong leathern
thong fastened by a slip-knot the lazo which bound the three
together being then loosed the horse rises with difficulty the
gaucho now holding fast the bridle fixed to the lower jaw leads the
horse outside the corral if a second man is present otherwise the
trouble is much greater he holds the animal s head whilst the first
puts on the horsecloths and saddle and girths the whole together 
during this operation the horse from dread and astonishment at thus
being bound round the waist throws himself over and over again on the
ground and till beaten is unwilling to rise at last when the
saddling is finished the poor animal can hardly breathe from fear and
is white with foam and sweat the man now prepares to mount by
pressing heavily on the stirrup so that the horse may not lose its
balance and at the moment that he throws his leg over the animal s
back he pulls the slip-knot binding the front legs and the beast is
free some domidors pull the knot while the animal is lying on the
ground and standing over the saddle allow him to rise beneath them 
the horse wild with dread gives a few most violent bounds and then
starts off at full gallop when quite exhausted the man by patience 
brings him back to the corral where reeking hot and scarcely alive 
the poor beast is let free those animals which will not gallop away 
but obstinately throw themselves on the ground are by far the most
troublesome this process is tremendously severe but in two or three
trials the horse is tamed it is not however for some weeks that the
animal is ridden with the iron bit and solid ring for it must learn to
associate the will of its rider with the feel of the rein before the
most powerful bridle can be of any service 

animals are so abundant in these countries that humanity and
self-interest are not closely united therefore i fear it is that the
former is here scarcely known one day riding in the pampas with a
very respectable estanciero my horse being tired lagged behind 
the man often shouted to me to spur him when i remonstrated that it
was a pity for the horse was quite exhausted he cried out why
not never mind spur him it is my horse i had then some difficulty
in making him comprehend that it was for the horse s sake and not on
his account that i did not choose to use my spurs he exclaimed with
a look of great surprise ah don carlos que cosa it was clear that
such an idea had never before entered his head 

the gauchos are well known to be perfect riders the idea of being
thrown let the horse do what it likes never enters their head their
criterion of a good rider is a man who can manage an untamed colt or
who if his horse falls alights on his own feet or can perform other
such exploits i have heard of a man betting that he would throw his
horse down twenty times and that nineteen times he would not fall
himself i recollect seeing a gaucho riding a very stubborn horse 
which three times successively reared so high as to fall backwards with
great violence the man judged with uncommon coolness the proper
moment for slipping off not an instant before or after the right time 
and as soon as the horse got up the man jumped on his back and at
last they started at a gallop the gaucho never appears to exert any
muscular force i was one day watching a good rider as we were
galloping along at a rapid pace and thought to myself surely if the
horse starts you appear so careless on your seat you must fall at
this moment a male ostrich sprang from its nest right beneath the
horse s nose the young colt bounded on one side like a stag but as
for the man all that could be said was that he started and took
fright with his horse 

in chile and peru more pains are taken with the mouth of the horse than
in la plata and this is evidently a consequence of the more intricate
nature of the country in chile a horse is not considered perfectly
broken till he can be brought up standing in the midst of his full
speed on any particular spot for instance on a cloak thrown on the
ground or again he will charge a wall and rearing scrape the
surface with his hoofs i have seen an animal bounding with spirit 
yet merely reined by a fore-finger and thumb taken at full gallop
across a courtyard and then made to wheel round the post of a veranda
with great speed but at so equal a distance that the rider with
outstretched arm all the while kept one finger rubbing the post then
making a demi-volte in the air with the other arm outstretched in a
like manner he wheeled round with astonishing force in an opposite
direction 

such a horse is well broken and although this at first may appear
useless it is far otherwise it is only carrying that which is daily
necessary into perfection when a bullock is checked and caught by the
lazo it will sometimes gallop round and round in a circle and the
horse being alarmed at the great strain if not well broken will not
readily turn like the pivot of a wheel in consequence many men have
been killed for if the lazo once takes a twist round a man s body it
will instantly from the power of the two opposed animals almost cut
him in twain on the same principle the races are managed the course
is only two or three hundred yards long the wish being to have horses
that can make a rapid dash the race-horses are trained not only to
stand with their hoofs touching a line but to draw all four feet
together so as at the first spring to bring into play the full action
of the hind-quarters in chile i was told an anecdote which i believe
was true and it offers a good illustration of the use of a well-broken
animal a respectable man riding one day met two others one of whom
was mounted on a horse which he knew to have been stolen from himself 
he challenged them they answered him by drawing their sabres and
giving chase the man on his good and fleet beast kept just ahead 
as he passed a thick bush he wheeled round it and brought up his horse
to a dead check the pursuers were obliged to shoot on one side and
ahead then instantly dashing on right behind them he buried his
knife in the back of one wounded the other recovered his horse from
the dying robber and rode home for these feats of horsemanship two
things are necessary a most severe bit like the mameluke the power
of which though seldom used the horse knows full well and large
blunt spurs that can be applied either as a mere touch or as an
instrument of extreme pain i conceive that with english spurs the
slightest touch of which pricks the skin it would be impossible to
break in a horse after the south american fashion 

at an estancia near las vacas large numbers of mares are weekly
slaughtered for the sake of their hides although worth only five paper
dollars or about half a crown apiece it seems at first strange that
it can answer to kill mares for such a trifle but as it is thought
ridiculous in this country ever to break in or ride a mare they are of
no value except for breeding the only thing for which i ever saw
mares used was to tread out wheat from the ear for which purpose they
were driven round a circular enclosure where the wheat-sheaves were
strewed the man employed for slaughtering the mares happened to be
celebrated for his dexterity with the lazo standing at the distance
of twelve yards from the mouth of the corral he has laid a wager that
he would catch by the legs every animal without missing one as it
rushed past him there was another man who said he would enter the
corral on foot catch a mare fasten her front legs together drive her
out throw her down kill skin and stake the hide for drying which
latter is a tedious job and he engaged that he would perform this
whole operation on twenty-two animals in one day or he would kill and
take the skin off fifty in the same time this would have been a
prodigious task for it is considered a good day s work to skin and
stake the hides of fifteen or sixteen animals 

november th i set out on my return in a direct line for monte
video having heard of some giant s bones at a neighbouring farm-house
on the sarandis a small stream entering the rio negro i rode there
accompanied by my host and purchased for the value of eighteen pence
the head of the toxodon when found it was quite perfect but the
boys knocked out some of the teeth with stones and then set up the
head as a mark to throw at by a most fortunate chance i found a
perfect tooth which exactly fitted one of the sockets in this skull 
embedded by itself on the banks of the rio tercero at the distance of
about miles from this place i found remains of this extraordinary
animal at two other places so that it must formerly have been common 
i found here also some large portions of the armour of a gigantic
armadillo-like animal and part of the great head of a mylodon the
bones of this head are so fresh that they contain according to the
analysis by mr t reeks seven per cent of animal matter and when
placed in a spirit-lamp they burn with a small flame the number of
the remains embedded in the grand estuary deposit which forms the
pampas and covers the granitic rocks of banda oriental must be
extraordinarily great i believe a straight line drawn in any
direction through the pampas would cut through some skeleton or bones 
besides those which i found during my short excursions i heard of many
others and the origin of such names as the stream of the animal 
 the hill of the giant is obvious at other times i heard of the
marvellous property of certain rivers which had the power of changing
small bones into large or as some maintained the bones themselves
grew as far as i am aware not one of these animals perished as was
formerly supposed in the marshes or muddy river-beds of the present
land but their bones have been exposed by the streams intersecting the
subaqueous deposit in which they were originally embedded we may
conclude that the whole area of the pampas is one wide sepulchre of
these extinct gigantic quadrupeds 

by the middle of the day on the th we arrived at monte video 
having been two days and a half on the road the country for the whole
way was of a very uniform character some parts being rather more rocky
and hilly than near the plata not far from monte video we passed
through the village of las pietras so named from some large rounded
masses of syenite its appearance was rather pretty in this country
a few fig-trees round a group of houses and a site elevated a hundred
feet above the general level ought always to be called picturesque 


during the last six months i have had an opportunity of seeing a little
of the character of the inhabitants of these provinces the gauchos 
or countryrmen are very superior to those who reside in the towns the
gaucho is invariably most obliging polite and hospitable i did not
meet with even one instance of rudeness or inhospitality he is
modest both respecting himself and country but at the same time a
spirited bold fellow on the other hand many robberies are
committed and there is much bloodshed the habit of constantly wearing
the knife is the chief cause of the latter it is lamentable to hear
how many lives are lost in trifling quarrels in fighting each party
tries to mark the face of his adversary by slashing his nose or eyes 
as is often attested by deep and horrid-looking scars robberies are a
natural consequence of universal gambling much drinking and extreme
indolence at mercedes i asked two men why they did not work one
gravely said the days were too long the other that he was too poor 
the number of horses and the profusion of food are the destruction of
all industry moreover there are so many feast-days and again 
nothing can succeed without it be begun when the moon is on the
increase so that half the month is lost from these two causes 

police and justice are quite inefficient if a man who is poor commits
murder and is taken he will be imprisoned and perhaps even shot but
if he is rich and has friends he may rely on it no very severe
consequence will ensue it is curious that the most respectable
inhabitants of the country invariably assist a murderer to escape they
seem to think that the individual sins against the government and not
against the people a traveller has no protection besides his
fire-arms and the constant habit of carrying them is the main check to
more frequent robberies the character of the higher and more educated
classes who reside in the towns partakes but perhaps in a lesser
degree of the good parts of the gaucho but is i fear stained by
many vices of which he is free sensuality mockery of all religion 
and the grossest corruption are far from uncommon nearly every
public officer can be bribed the head man in the post-office sold
forged government franks the governor and prime minister openly
combined to plunder the state justice where gold came into play was
hardly expected by any one i knew an englishman who went to the
chief justice he told me that not then understanding the ways of the
place he trembled as he entered the room and said sir i have come
to offer you two hundred paper dollars value about five pounds
sterling if you will arrest before a certain time a man who has
cheated me i know it is against the law but my lawyer naming him 
recommended me to take this step the chief justice smiled
acquiescence thanked him and the man before night was safe in prison 
with this entire want of principle in many of the leading men with the
country full of ill-paid turbulent officers the people yet hope that a
democratic form of government can succeed 

on first entering society in these countries two or three features
strike one as particularly remarkable the polite and dignified
manners pervading every rank of life the excellent taste displayed by
the women in their dresses and the equality amongst all ranks at the
rio colorado some men who kept the humblest shops used to dine with
general rosas a son of a major at bahia blanca gained his livelihood
by making paper cigars and he wished to accompany me as guide or
servant to buenos ayres but his father objected on the score of the
danger alone many officers in the army can neither read nor write 
yet all meet in society as equals in entre rios the sala consisted
of only six representatives one of them kept a common shop and
evidently was not degraded by the office all this is what would be
expected in a new country nevertheless the absence of gentlemen by
profession appears to an englishman something strange 

when speaking of these countries the manner in which they have been
brought up by their unnatural parent spain should always be borne in
mind on the whole perhaps more credit is due for what has been
done than blame for that which may be deficient it is impossible to
doubt but that the extreme liberalism of these countries must
ultimately lead to good results the very general toleration of
foreign religions the regard paid to the means of education the
freedom of the press the facilities offered to all foreigners and
especially as i am bound to add to every one professing the humblest
pretensions to science should be recollected with gratitude by those
who have visited spanish south america 

december th the beagle sailed from the rio plata never again to
enter its muddy stream our course was directed to port desire on the
coast of patagonia before proceeding any further i will here put
together a few observations made at sea 

several times when the ship has been some miles off the mouth of the
plata and at other times when off the shores of northern patagonia we
have been surrounded by insects one evening when we were about ten
miles from the bay of san blas vast numbers of butterflies in bands
or flocks of countless myriads extended as far as the eye could range 
even by the aid of a telescope it was not possible to see a space free
from butterflies the seamen cried out it was snowing butterflies 
and such in fact was the appearance more species than one were
present but the main part belonged to a kind very similar to but not
identical with the common english colias edusa some moths and
hymenoptera accompanied the butterflies and a fine beetle calosoma 
flew on board other instances are known of this beetle having been
caught far out at sea and this is the more remarkable as the greater
number of the carabidae seldom or never take wing the day had been
fine and calm and the one previous to it equally so with light and
variable airs hence we cannot suppose that the insects were blown off
the land but we must conclude that they voluntarily took flight the
great bands of the colias seem at first to afford an instance like
those on record of the migrations of another butterfly vanessa cardui 
 but the presence of other insects makes the case distinct and even
less intelligible before sunset a strong breeze sprung up from the
north and this must have caused tens of thousands of the butterflies
and other insects to have perished 

on another occasion when seventeen miles off cape corrientes i had a
net overboard to catch pelagic animals upon drawing it up to my
surprise i found a considerable number of beetles in it and although
in the open sea they did not appear much injured by the salt water i
lost some of the specimens but those which i preserved belonged to the
genera colymbetes hydroporus hydrobius two species notaphus 
cynucus adimonia and scarabaeus at first i thought that these
insects had been blown from the shore but upon reflecting that out of
the eight species four were aquatic and two others partly so in their
habits it appeared to me most probable that they were floated into the
sea by a small stream which drains a lake near cape corrientes on any
supposition it is an interesting circumstance to find live insects
swimming in the open ocean seventeen miles from the nearest point of
land there are several accounts of insects having been blown off the
patagonian shore captain cook observed it as did more lately captain
king of the adventure the cause probably is due to the want of
shelter both of trees and hills so that an insect on the wing with an
off-shore breeze would be very apt to be blown out to sea the most
remarkable instance i have known of an insect being caught far from the
land was that of a large grasshopper acrydium which flew on board 
when the beagle was to windward of the cape de verd islands and when
the nearest point of land not directly opposed to the trade-wind was
cape blanco on the coast of africa miles distant 

on several occasions when the beagle has been within the mouth of the
plata the rigging has been coated with the web of the gossamer spider 
one day november st i paid particular attention to this
subject the weather had been fine and clear and in the morning the
air was full of patches of the flocculent web as on an autumnal day in
england the ship was sixty miles distant from the land in the
direction of a steady though light breeze vast numbers of a small
spider about one-tenth of an inch in length and of a dusky red
colour were attached to the webs there must have been i should
suppose some thousands on the ship the little spider when first
coming in contact with the rigging was always seated on a single
thread and not on the flocculent mass this latter seems merely to be
produced by the entanglement of the single threads the spiders were
all of one species but of both sexes together with young ones these
latter were distinguished by their smaller size and more dusky colour 
i will not give the description of this spider but merely state that
it does not appear to me to be included in any of latreille s genera 
the little aeronaut as soon as it arrived on board was very active 
running about sometimes letting itself fall and then reascending the
same thread sometimes employing itself in making a small and very
irregular mesh in the corners between the ropes it could run with
facility on the surface of the water when disturbed it lifted up its
front legs in the attitude of attention on its first arrival it
appeared very thirsty and with exserted maxillae drank eagerly of
drops of water this same circumstance has been observed by strack may
it not be in consequence of the little insect having passed through a
dry and rarefied atmosphere its stock of web seemed inexhaustible 
while watching some that were suspended by a single thread i several
times observed that the slightest breath of air bore them away out of
sight in a horizontal line 

on another occasion th under similar circumstances i repeatedly
observed the same kind of small spider either when placed or having
crawled on some little eminence elevate its abdomen send forth a
thread and then sail away horizontally but with a rapidity which was
quite unaccountable i thought i could perceive that the spider 
before performing the above preparatory steps connected its legs
together with the most delicate threads but i am not sure whether this
observation was correct 

one day at st fe i had a better opportunity of observing some
similar facts a spider which was about three-tenths of an inch in
length and which in its general appearance resembled a citigrade
 therefore quite different from the gossamer while standing on the
summit of a post darted forth four or five threads from its spinners 
these glittering in the sunshine might be compared to diverging rays
of light they were not however straight but in undulations like
films of silk blown by the wind they were more than a yard in length 
and diverged in an ascending direction from the orifices the spider
then suddenly let go its hold of the post and was quickly borne out of
sight the day was hot and apparently calm yet under such
circumstances the atmosphere can never be so tranquil as not to affect
a vane so delicate as the thread of a spider s web if during a warm
day we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a bank or over
a level plain at a distant landmark the effect of an ascending current
of heated air is almost always evident such upward currents it has
been remarked are also shown by the ascent of soap-bubbles which will
not rise in an in-doors room hence i think there is not much
difficulty in understanding the ascent of the fine lines projected from
a spider s spinners and afterwards of the spider itself the
divergence of the lines has been attempted to be explained i believe
by mr murray by their similar electrical condition the circumstance
of spiders of the same species but of different sexes and ages being
found on several occasions at the distance of many leagues from the
land attached in vast numbers to the lines renders it probable that
the habit of sailing through the air is as characteristic of this
tribe as that of diving is of the argyroneta we may then reject
latreille s supposition that the gossamer owes its origin
indifferently to the young of several genera of spiders although as
we have seen the young of other spiders do possess the power of
performing aerial voyages 

during our different passages south of the plata i often towed astern
a net made of bunting and thus caught many curious animals of
crustacea there were many strange and undescribed genera one which
in some respects is allied to the notopods or those crabs which have
their posterior legs placed almost on their backs for the purpose of
adhering to the under side of rocks is very remarkable from the
structure of its hind pair of legs the penultimate joint instead of
terminating in a simple claw ends in three bristle-like appendages of
dissimilar lengths the longest equalling that of the entire leg these
claws are very thin and are serrated with the finest teeth directed
backwards their curved extremities are flattened and on this part
five most minute cups are placed which seem to act in the same manner
as the suckers on the arms of the cuttle-fish as the animal lives in
the open sea and probably wants a place of rest i suppose this
beautiful and most anomalous structure is adapted to take hold of
floating marine animals 

in deep water far from the land the number of living creatures is
extremely small south of the latitude degs i never succeeded in
catching anything besides some beroe and a few species of minute
entomostracous crustacea in shoaler water at the distance of a few
miles from the coast very many kinds of crustacea and some other
animals are numerous but only during the night between latitudes 
and degs south of cape horn the net was put astern several times 
it never however brought up anything besides a few of two extremely
minute species of entomostraca yet whales and seals petrels and
albatross are exceedingly abundant throughout this part of the ocean 
it has always been a mystery to me on what the albatross which lives
far from the shore can subsist i presume that like the condor it is
able to fast long and that one good feast on the carcass of a putrid
whale lasts for a long time the central and intertropical parts of
the atlantic swarm with pteropoda crustacea and radiata and with
their devourers the flying-fish and again with their devourers the
bonitos and albicores i presume that the numerous lower pelagic
animals feed on the infusoria which are now known from the researches
of ehrenberg to abound in the open ocean but on what in the clear
blue water do these infusoria subsist 

while sailing a little south of the plata on one very dark night the
sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle there was a
fresh breeze and every part of the surface which during the day is
seen as foam now glowed with a pale light the vessel drove before
her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus and in her wake she was
followed by a milky train as far as the eye reached the crest of
every wave was bright and the sky above the horizon from the
reflected glare of these livid flames was not so utterly obscure as
over the vault of the heavens 

as we proceed further southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent and
off cape horn i do not recollect more than once having seen it so and
then it was far from being brilliant this circumstance probably has a
close connection with the scarcity of organic beings in that part of
the ocean after the elaborate paper by ehrenberg on the
phosphorescence of the sea it is almost superfluous on my part to make
any observations on the subject i may however add that the same torn
and irregular particles of gelatinous matter described by ehrenberg 
seem in the southern as well as in the northern hemisphere to be the
common cause of this phenomenon the particles were so minute as
easily to pass through fine gauze yet many were distinctly visible by
the naked eye the water when placed in a tumbler and agitated gave
out sparks but a small portion in a watch-glass scarcely ever was
luminous ehrenberg states that these particles all retain a certain
degree of irritability my observations some of which were made
directly after taking up the water gave a different result i may
also mention that having used the net during one night i allowed it
to become partially dry and having occasion twelve hours afterwards to
employ it again i found the whole surface sparkled as brightly as when
first taken out of the water it does not appear probable in this case 
that the particles could have remained so long alive on one occasion
having kept a jelly-fish of the genus dianaea till it was dead the
water in which it was placed became luminous when the waves
scintillate with bright green sparks i believe it is generally owing
to minute crustacea but there can be no doubt that very many other
pelagic animals when alive are phosphorescent 

on two occasions i have observed the sea luminous at considerable
depths beneath the surface near the mouth of the plata some circular
and oval patches from two to four yards in diameter and with defined
outlines shone with a steady but pale light while the surrounding
water only gave out a few sparks the appearance resembled the
reflection of the moon or some luminous body for the edges were
sinuous from the undulations of the surface the ship which drew
thirteen feet of water passed over without disturbing these patches 
therefore we must suppose that some animals were congregated together
at a greater depth than the bottom of the vessel 

near fernando noronha the sea gave out light in flashes the appearance
was very similar to that which might be expected from a large fish
moving rapidly through a luminous fluid to this cause the sailors
attributed it at the time however i entertained some doubts on
account of the frequency and rapidity of the flashes i have already
remarked that the phenomenon is very much more common in warm than in
cold countries and i have sometimes imagined that a disturbed
electrical condition of the atmosphere was most favourable to its
production certainly i think the sea is most luminous after a few
days of more calm weather than ordinary during which time it has
swarmed with various animals observing that the water charged with
gelatinous particles is in an impure state and that the luminous
appearance in all common cases is produced by the agitation of the
fluid in contact with the atmosphere i am inclined to consider that
the phosphorescence is the result of the decomposition of the organic
particles by which process one is tempted almost to call it a kind of
respiration the ocean becomes purified 

december rd we arrived at port desire situated in lat degs 
on the coast of patagonia the creek runs for about twenty miles
inland with an irregular width the beagle anchored a few miles
within the entrance in front of the ruins of an old spanish settlement 

the same evening i went on shore the first landing in any new country
is very interesting and especially when as in this case the whole
aspect bears the stamp of a marked and individual character at the
height of between two and three hundred feet above some masses of
porphyry a wide plain extends which is truly characteristic of
patagonia the surface is quite level and is composed of well-rounded
shingle mixed with a whitish earth here and there scattered tufts of
brown wiry grass are supported and still more rarely some low thorny
bushes the weather is dry and pleasant and the fine blue sky is but
seldom obscured when standing in the middle of one of these desert
plains and looking towards the interior the view is generally bounded
by the escarpment of another plain rather higher but equally level
and desolate and in every other direction the horizon is indistinct
from the trembling mirage which seems to rise from the heated surface 

in such a country the fate of the spanish settlement was soon decided 
the dryness of the climate during the greater part of the year and the
occasional hostile attacks of the wandering indians compelled the
colonists to desert their half-finished buildings the style however 
in which they were commenced shows the strong and liberal hand of spain
in the old time the result of all the attempts to colonize this side
of america south of degs has been miserable port famine
expresses by its name the lingering and extreme sufferings of several
hundred wretched people of whom one alone survived to relate their
misfortunes at st joseph s bay on the coast of patagonia a small
settlement was made but during one sunday the indians made an attack
and massacred the whole party excepting two men who remained captives
during many years at the rio negro i conversed with one of these men 
now in extreme old age 

the zoology of patagonia is as limited as its flora on the arid
plains a few black beetles heteromera might be seen slowly crawling
about and occasionally a lizard darted from side to side of birds we
have three carrion hawks and in the valleys a few finches and
insect-feeders an ibis theristicus melanops a species said to be
found in central africa is not uncommon on the most desert parts in
their stomachs i found grasshoppers cicadae small lizards and even
scorpions at one time of the year these birds go in flocks at
another in pairs their cry is very loud and singular like the
neighing of the guanaco 

the guanaco or wild llama is the characteristic quadruped of the
plains of patagonia it is the south american representative of the
camel of the east it is an elegant animal in a state of nature with
a long slender neck and fine legs it is very common over the whole of
the temperate parts of the continent as far south as the islands near
cape horn it generally lives in small herds of from half a dozen to
thirty in each but on the banks of the st cruz we saw one herd which
must have contained at least five hundred 

they are generally wild and extremely wary mr stokes told me that
he one day saw through a glass a herd of these animals which evidently
had been frightened and were running away at full speed although
their distance was so great that he could not distinguish them with his
naked eye the sportsman frequently receives the first notice of their
presence by hearing from a long distance their peculiar shrill
neighing note of alarm if he then looks attentively he will probably
see the herd standing in a line on the side of some distant hill on
approaching nearer a few more squeals are given and off they set at
an apparently slow but really quick canter along some narrow beaten
track to a neighbouring hill if however by chance he abruptly meets
a single animal or several together they will generally stand
motionless and intently gaze at him then perhaps move on a few yards 
turn round and look again what is the cause of this difference in
their shyness do they mistake a man in the distance for their chief
enemy the puma or does curiosity overcome their timidity that they
are curious is certain for if a person lies on the ground and plays
strange antics such as throwing up his feet in the air they will
almost always approach by degrees to reconnoitre him it was an
artifice that was repeatedly practised by our sportsmen with success 
and it had moreover the advantage of allowing several shots to be
fired which were all taken as parts of the performance on the
mountains of tierra del fuego i have more than once seen a guanaco on
being approached not only neigh and squeal but prance and leap about
in the most ridiculous manner apparently in defiance as a challenge 
these animals are very easily domesticated and i have seen some thus
kept in northern patagonia near a house though not under any
restraint they are in this state very bold and readily attack a man
by striking him from behind with both knees it is asserted that the
motive for these attacks is jealousy on account of their females the
wild guanacos however have no idea of defence even a single dog will
secure one of these large animals till the huntsman can come up in
many of their habits they are like sheep in a flock thus when they see
men approaching in several directions on horseback they soon become
bewildered and know not which way to run this greatly facilitates
the indian method of hunting for they are thus easily driven to a
central point and are encompassed 

the guanacos readily take to the water several times at port valdes
they were seen swimming from island to island byron in his voyage
says he saw them drinking salt water some of our officers likewise saw
a herd apparently drinking the briny fluid from a salina near cape
blanco i imagine in several parts of the country if they do not
drink salt water they drink none at all in the middle of the day
they frequently roll in the dust in saucer-shaped hollows the males
fight together two one day passed quite close to me squealing and
trying to bite each other and several were shot with their hides
deeply scored herds sometimes appear to set out on exploring parties 
at bahia blanca where within thirty miles of the coast these animals
are extremely unfrequent i one day saw the tracks of thirty or forty 
which had come in a direct line to a muddy salt-water creek they then
must have perceived that they were approaching the sea for they had
wheeled with the regularity of cavalry and had returned back in as
straight a line as they had advanced the guanacos have one singular
habit which is to me quite inexplicable namely that on successive
days they drop their dung in the same defined heap i saw one of these
heaps which was eight feet in diameter and was composed of a large
quantity this habit according to m a d orbigny is common to all
the species of the genus it is very useful to the peruvian indians 
who use the dung for fuel and are thus saved the trouble of collecting
it 

the guanacos appear to have favourite spots for lying down to die on
the banks of the st cruz in certain circumscribed spaces which were
generally bushy and all near the river the ground was actually white
with bones on one such spot i counted between ten and twenty heads i
particularly examined the bones they did not appear as some scattered
ones which i had seen gnawed or broken as if dragged together by
beasts of prey the animals in most cases must have crawled before
dying beneath and amongst the bushes mr bynoe informs me that
during a former voyage he observed the same circumstance on the banks
of the rio gallegos i do not at all understand the reason of this 
but i may observe that the wounded guanacos at the st cruz invariably
walked towards the river at st jago in the cape de verd islands i
remember having seen in a ravine a retired corner covered with bones of
the goat we at the time exclaimed that it was the burial ground of all
the goats in the island i mention these trifling circumstances 
because in certain cases they might explain the occurrence of a number
of uninjured bones in a cave or buried under alluvial accumulations 
and likewise the cause why certain animals are more commonly embedded
than others in sedimentary deposits 

one day the yawl was sent under the command of mr chaffers with three
days provisions to survey the upper part of the harbour in the
morning we searched for some watering-places mentioned in an old
spanish chart we found one creek at the head of which there was a
trickling rill the first we had seen of brackish water here the
tide compelled us to wait several hours and in the interval i walked
some miles into the interior the plain as usual consisted of gravel 
mingled with soil resembling chalk in appearance but very different
from it in nature from the softness of these materials it was worn
into many gulleys there was not a tree and excepting the guanaco 
which stood on the hill-top a watchful sentinel over its herd scarcely
an animal or a bird all was stillness and desolation yet in passing
over these scenes without one bright object near an ill-defined but
strong sense of pleasure is vividly excited one asked how many ages
the plain had thus lasted and how many more it was doomed thus to
continue 

 none can reply all seems eternal now the wilderness has a mysterious
tongue which teaches awful doubt 

in the evening we sailed a few miles further up and then pitched the
tents for the night by the middle of the next day the yawl was
aground and from the shoalness of the water could not proceed any
higher the water being found partly fresh mr chaffers took the
dingey and went up two or three miles further where she also grounded 
but in a fresh-water river the water was muddy and though the stream
was most insignificant in size it would be difficult to account for
its origin except from the melting snow on the cordillera at the
spot where we bivouacked we were surrounded by bold cliffs and steep
pinnacles of porphyry i do not think i ever saw a spot which appeared
more secluded from the rest of the world than this rocky crevice in
the wide plain 

the second day after our return to the anchorage a party of officers
and myself went to ransack an old indian grave which i had found on
the summit of a neighbouring hill two immense stones each probably
weighing at least a couple of tons had been placed in front of a ledge
of rock about six feet high at the bottom of the grave on the hard
rock there was a layer of earth about a foot deep which must have been
brought up from the plain below above it a pavement of flat stones
was placed on which others were piled so as to fill up the space
between the ledge and the two great blocks to complete the grave the
indians had contrived to detach from the ledge a huge fragment and to
throw it over the pile so as to rest on the two blocks we undermined
the grave on both sides but could not find any relics or even bones 
the latter probably had decayed long since in which case the grave
must have been of extreme antiquity for i found in another place some
smaller heaps beneath which a very few crumbling fragments could yet be
distinguished as having belonged to a man falconer states that where
an indian dies he is buried but that subsequently his bones are
carefully taken up and carried let the distance be ever so great to
be deposited near the sea-coast this custom i think may be
accounted for by recollecting that before the introduction of horses 
these indians must have led nearly the same life as the fuegians now
do and therefore generally have resided in the neighbourhood of the
sea the common prejudice of lying where one s ancestors have lain 
would make the now roaming indians bring the less perishable part of
their dead to their ancient burial-ground on the coast 

january th before it was dark the beagle anchored in the fine
spacious harbour of port st julian situated about one hundred and ten
miles to the south of port desire we remained here eight days the
country is nearly similar to that of port desire but perhaps rather
more sterile one day a party accompanied captain fitz roy on a long
walk round the head of the harbour we were eleven hours without
tasting any water and some of the party were quite exhausted from
the summit of a hill since well named thirsty hill a fine lake was
spied and two of the party proceeded with concerted signals to show
whether it was fresh water what was our disappointment to find a
snow-white expanse of salt crystallized in great cubes we attributed
our extreme thirst to the dryness of the atmosphere but whatever the
cause might be we were exceedingly glad late in the evening to get
back to the boats although we could nowhere find during our whole
visit a single drop of fresh water yet some must exist for by an odd
chance i found on the surface of the salt water near the head of the
bay a colymbetes not quite dead which must have lived in some not far
distant pool three other insects a cincindela like hybrida a
cymindis and a harpalus which all live on muddy flats occasionally
overflowed by the sea and one other found dead on the plain complete
the list of the beetles a good-sized fly tabanus was extremely
numerous and tormented us by its painful bite the common horsefly 
which is so troublesome in the shady lanes of england belongs to this
same genus we here have the puzzle that so frequently occurs in the
case of musquitoes on the blood of what animals do these insects
commonly feed the guanaco is nearly the only warm-blooded quadruped 
and it is found in quite inconsiderable numbers compared with the
multitude of flies 

the geology of patagonia is interesting differently from europe 
where the tertiary formations appear to have accumulated in bays here
along hundreds of miles of coast we have one great deposit including
many tertiary shells all apparently extinct the most common shell is
a massive gigantic oyster sometimes even a foot in diameter these
beds are covered by others of a peculiar soft white stone including
much gypsum and resembling chalk but really of a pumiceous nature it
is highly remarkable from being composed to at least one-tenth of its
bulk of infusoria professor ehrenberg has already ascertained in it
thirty oceanic forms this bed extends for miles along the coast 
and probably for a considerably greater distance at port st julian
its thickness is more than feet these white beds are everywhere
capped by a mass of gravel forming probably one of the largest beds of
shingle in the world it certainly extends from near the rio colorado
to between and nautical miles southward at santa cruz a river
a little south of st julian it reaches to the foot of the
cordillera half way up the river its thickness is more than feet 
it probably everywhere extends to this great chain whence the
well-rounded pebbles of porphyry have been derived we may consider its
average breadth as miles and its average thickness as about 
feet if this great bed of pebbles without including the mud
necessarily derived from their attrition was piled into a mound it
would form a great mountain chain when we consider that all these
pebbles countless as the grains of sand in the desert have been
derived from the slow falling of masses of rock on the old coast-lines
and banks of rivers and that these fragments have been dashed into
smaller pieces and that each of them has since been slowly rolled 
rounded and far transported the mind is stupefied in thinking over the
long absolutely necessary lapse of years yet all this gravel has
been transported and probably rounded subsequently to the deposition
of the white beds and long subsequently to the underlying beds with
the tertiary shells 

everything in this southern continent has been effected on a grand
scale the land from the rio plata to tierra del fuego a distance of
 miles has been raised in mass and in patagonia to a height of
between and feet within the period of the now existing
sea-shells the old and weathered shells left on the surface of the
upraised plain still partially retain their colours the uprising
movement has been interrupted by at least eight long periods of rest 
during which the sea ate deeply back into the land forming at
successive levels the long lines of cliffs or escarpments which
separate the different plains as they rise like steps one behind the
other the elevatory movement and the eating-back power of the sea
during the periods of rest have been equable over long lines of coast 
for i was astonished to find that the step-like plains stand at nearly
corresponding heights at far distant points the lowest plain is 
feet high and the highest which i ascended near the coast is 
feet and of this only relics are left in the form of flat
gravel-capped hills the upper plain of santa cruz slopes up to a
height of feet at the foot of the cordillera i have said that
within the period of existing sea-shells patagonia has been upraised
 to feet i may add that within the period when icebergs
transported boulders over the upper plain of santa cruz the elevation
has been at least feet nor has patagonia been affected only by
upward movements the extinct tertiary shells from port st julian and
santa cruz cannot have lived according to professor e forbes in a
greater depth of water than from to feet but they are now
covered with sea-deposited strata from to feet in thickness 
hence the bed of the sea on which these shells once lived must have
sunk downwards several hundred feet to allow of the accumulation of
the superincumbent strata what a history of geological changes does
the simply-constructed coast of patagonia reveal 

at port st julian in some red mud capping the gravel on the
feet plain i found half the skeleton of the macrauchenia
patachonica a remarkable quadruped full as large as a camel it
belongs to the same division of the pachydermata with the rhinoceros 
tapir and palaeotherium but in the structure of the bones of its long
neck it shows a clear relation to the camel or rather to the guanaco
and llama from recent sea-shells being found on two of the higher
step-formed plains which must have been modelled and upraised before
the mud was deposited in which the macrauchenia was entombed it is
certain that this curious quadruped lived long after the sea was
inhabited by its present shells i was at first much surprised how a
large quadruped could so lately have subsisted in lat degs 
on these wretched gravel plains with their stunted vegetation but the
relationship of the macrauchenia to the guanaco now an inhabitant of
the most sterile parts partly explains this difficulty 

the relationship though distant between the macrauchenia and the
guanaco between the toxodon and the capybara the closer relationship
between the many extinct edentata and the living sloths ant-eaters 
and armadillos now so eminently characteristic of south american
zoology and the still closer relationship between the fossil and
living species of ctenomys and hydrochaerus are most interesting
facts this relationship is shown wonderfully as wonderfully as
between the fossil and extinct marsupial animals of australia by the
great collection lately brought to europe from the caves of brazil by
mm lund and clausen in this collection there are extinct species of
all the thirty-two genera excepting four of the terrestrial
quadrupeds now inhabiting the provinces in which the caves occur and
the extinct species are much more numerous than those now living there
are fossil ant-eaters armadillos tapirs peccaries guanacos 
opossums and numerous south american gnawers and monkeys and other
animals this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the
dead and the living will i do not doubt hereafter throw more light
on the appearance of organic beings on our earth and their
disappearance from it than any other class of facts 

it is impossible to reflect on the changed state of the american
continent without the deepest astonishment formerly it must have
swarmed with great monsters now we find mere pigmies compared with
the antecedent allied races if buffon had known of the gigantic
sloth and armadillo-like animals and of the lost pachydermata he
might have said with a greater semblance of truth that the creative
force in america had lost its power rather than that it had never
possessed great vigour the greater number if not all of these
extinct quadrupeds lived at a late period and were the contemporaries
of most of the existing sea-shells since they lived no very great
change in the form of the land can have taken place what then has
exterminated so many species and whole genera the mind at first is
irresistibly hurried into the belief of some great catastrophe but
thus to destroy animals both large and small in southern patagonia 
in brazil on the cordillera of peru in north america up to behring s
straits we must shake the entire framework of the globe an
examination moreover of the geology of la plata and patagonia leads
to the belief that all the features of the land result from slow and
gradual changes it appears from the character of the fossils in
europe asia australia and in north and south america that those
conditions which favour the life of the larger quadrupeds were lately
co-extensive with the world what those conditions were no one has yet
even conjectured it could hardly have been a change of temperature 
which at about the same time destroyed the inhabitants of tropical 
temperate and arctic latitudes on both sides of the globe in north
america we positively know from mr lyell that the large quadrupeds
lived subsequently to that period when boulders were brought into
latitudes at which icebergs now never arrive from conclusive but
indirect reasons we may feel sure that in the southern hemisphere the
macrauchenia also lived long subsequently to the ice-transporting
boulder-period did man after his first inroad into south america 
destroy as has been suggested the unwieldy megatherium and the other
edentata we must at least look to some other cause for the
destruction of the little tucutuco at bahia blanca and of the many
fossil mice and other small quadrupeds in brazil no one will imagine
that a drought even far severer than those which cause such losses in
the provinces of la plata could destroy every individual of every
species from southern patagonia to behring s straits what shall we
say of the extinction of the horse did those plains fail of pasture 
which have since been overrun by thousands and hundreds of thousands of
the descendants of the stock introduced by the spaniards have the
subsequently introduced species consumed the food of the great
antecedent races can we believe that the capybara has taken the food
of the toxodon the guanaco of the macrauchenia the existing small
edentata of their numerous gigantic prototypes certainly no fact in
the long history of the world is so startling as the wide and repeated
exterminations of its inhabitants 

nevertheless if we consider the subject under another point of view 
it will appear less perplexing we do not steadily bear in mind how
profoundly ignorant we are of the conditions of existence of every
animal nor do we always remember that some check is constantly
preventing the too rapid increase of every organized being left in a
state of nature the supply of food on an average remains constant 
yet the tendency in every animal to increase by propagation is
geometrical and its surprising effects have nowhere been more
astonishingly shown than in the case of the european animals run wild
during the last few centuries in america every animal in a state of
nature regularly breeds yet in a species long established any great 
increase in numbers is obviously impossible and must be checked by
some means we are nevertheless seldom able with certainty to tell in
any given species at what period of life or at what period of the
year or whether only at long intervals the check falls or again 
what is the precise nature of the check hence probably it is that we
feel so little surprise at one of two species closely allied in
habits being rare and the other abundant in the same district or 
again that one should be abundant in one district and another 
filling the same place in the economy of nature should be abundant in
a neighbouring district differing very little in its conditions if
asked how this is one immediately replies that it is determined by
some slight difference in climate food or the number of enemies yet
how rarely if ever we can point out the precise cause and manner of
action of the check we are therefore driven to the conclusion that
causes generally quite inappreciable by us determine whether a given
species shall be abundant or scanty in numbers 

in the cases where we can trace the extinction of a species through
man either wholly or in one limited district we know that it becomes
rarer and rarer and is then lost it would be difficult to point out
any just distinction between a species destroyed by man or by the
increase of its natural enemies the evidence of rarity preceding
extinction is more striking in the successive tertiary strata as
remarked by several able observers it has often been found that a
shell very common in a tertiary stratum is now most rare and has even
long been thought extinct if then as appears probable species first
become rare and then extinct if the too rapid increase of every
species even the most favoured is steadily checked as we must admit 
though how and when it is hard to say and if we see without the
smallest surprise though unable to assign the precise reason one
species abundant and another closely allied species rare in the same
district why should we feel such great astonishment at the rarity
being carried one step further to extinction an action going on on
every side of us and yet barely appreciable might surely be carried a
little further without exciting our observation who would feel any
great surprise at hearing that the magalonyx was formerly rare compared
with the megatherium or that one of the fossil monkeys was few in
number compared with one of the now living monkeys and yet in this
comparative rarity we should have the plainest evidence of less
favourable conditions for their existence to admit that species
generally become rare before they become extinct to feel no surprise
at the comparative rarity of one species with another and yet to call
in some extraordinary agent and to marvel greatly when a species ceases
to exist appears to me much the same as to admit that sickness in the
individual is the prelude to death to feel no surprise at
sickness but when the sick man dies to wonder and to believe that he
died through violence

santa cruz patagonia and the falkland islands

santa cruz expedition up the river indians immense streams of
basaltic lava fragments not transported by the river excavations of
the valley condor habits of cordillera erratic boulders of great
size indian relics return to the ship falkland islands wild
horses cattle rabbits wolf-like fox fire made of bones manner of
hunting wild cattle geology streams of stones scenes of
violence penguins geese eggs of doris compound animals 


april the beagle anchored within the mouth of the santa
cruz this river is situated about sixty miles south of port st 
julian during the last voyage captain stokes proceeded thirty miles
up it but then from the want of provisions was obliged to return 
excepting what was discovered at that time scarcely anything was known
about this large river captain fitz roy now determined to follow its
course as far as time would allow on the th three whale-boats
started carrying three weeks provisions and the party consisted of
twenty-five souls a force which would have been sufficient to have
defied a host of indians with a strong flood-tide and a fine day we
made a good run soon drank some of the fresh water and were at night
nearly above the tidal influence 

the river here assumed a size and appearance which even at the highest
point we ultimately reached was scarcely diminished it was generally
from three to four hundred yards broad and in the middle about
seventeen feet deep the rapidity of the current which in its whole
course runs at the rate of from four to six knots an hour is perhaps
its most remarkable feature the water is of a fine blue colour but
with a slight milky tinge and not so transparent as at first sight
would have been expected it flows over a bed of pebbles like those
which compose the beach and the surrounding plains it runs in a
winding course through a valley which extends in a direct line
westward this valley varies from five to ten miles in breadth it is
bounded by step-formed terraces which rise in most parts one above
the other to the height of five hundred feet and have on the opposite
sides a remarkable correspondence 

april th against so strong a current it was of course quite
impossible to row or sail consequently the three boats were fastened
together head and stern two hands left in each and the rest came on
shore to track as the general arrangements made by captain fitz roy
were very good for facilitating the work of all and as all had a share
in it i will describe the system the party including every one was
divided into two spells each of which hauled at the tracking line
alternately for an hour and a half the officers of each boat lived
with ate the same food and slept in the same tent with their crew so
that each boat was quite independent of the others after sunset the
first level spot where any bushes were growing was chosen for our
night s lodging each of the crew took it in turns to be cook 
immediately the boat was hauled up the cook made his fire two others
pitched the tent the coxswain handed the things out of the boat the
rest carried them up to the tents and collected firewood by this
order in half an hour everything was ready for the night a watch of
two men and an officer was always kept whose duty it was to look after
the boats keep up the fire and guard against indians each in the
party had his one hour every night 

during this day we tracked but a short distance for there were many
islets covered by thorny bushes and the channels between them were
shallow 

april th we passed the islands and set to work our regular day s
march although it was hard enough carried us on an average only ten
miles in a straight line and perhaps fifteen or twenty altogether 
beyond the place where we slept last night the country is completely
 terra incognita for it was there that captain stokes turned back we
saw in the distance a great smoke and found the skeleton of a horse 
so we knew that indians were in the neighbourhood on the next morning
 st tracks of a party of horse and marks left by the trailing of the
chuzos or long spears were observed on the ground it was generally
thought that the indians had reconnoitred us during the night shortly
afterwards we came to a spot where from the fresh footsteps of men 
children and horses it was evident that the party had crossed the
river 

april nd the country remained the same and was extremely
uninteresting the complete similarity of the productions throughout
patagonia is one of its most striking characters the level plains of
arid shingle support the same stunted and dwarf plants and in the
valleys the same thorn-bearing bushes grow everywhere we see the same
birds and insects even the very banks of the river and of the clear
streamlets which entered it were scarcely enlivened by a brighter tint
of green the curse of sterility is on the land and the water flowing
over a bed of pebbles partakes of the same curse hence the number of
water-fowls is very scanty for there is nothing to support life in the
stream of this barren river 

patagonia poor as she is in some respects can however boast of a
greater stock of small rodents than perhaps any other country in
the world several species of mice are externally characterized by
large thin ears and a very fine fur these little animals swarm
amongst the thickets in the valleys where they cannot for months
together taste a drop of water excepting the dew they all seem to be
cannibals for no sooner was a mouse caught in one of my traps that it
was devoured by others a small and delicately shaped fox which is
likewise very abundant probably derives its entire support from these
small animals the guanaco is also in his proper district herds of
fifty or a hundred were common and as i have stated we saw one which
must have contained at least five hundred the puma with the condor
and other carrion-hawks in its train follows and preys upon these
animals the footsteps of the puma were to be seen almost everywhere
on the banks of the river and the remains of several guanacos with
their necks dislocated and bones broken showed how they had met their
death 

april th like the navigators of old when approaching an unknown
land we examined and watched for the most trivial sign of a change 
the drifted trunk of a tree or a boulder of primitive rock was hailed
with joy as if we had seen a forest growing on the flanks of the
cordillera the top however of a heavy bank of clouds which
remained almost constantly in one position was the most promising
sign and eventually turned out a true harbinger at first the clouds
were mistaken for the mountains themselves instead of the masses of
vapour condensed by their icy summits 

april th we this day met with a marked change in the geological
structure of the plains from the first starting i had carefully
examined the gravel in the river and for the two last days had noticed
the presence of a few small pebbles of a very cellular basalt these
gradually increased in number and in size but none were as large as a
man s head this morning however pebbles of the same rock but more
compact suddenly became abundant and in the course of half an hour we
saw at the distance of five of six miles the angular edge of a great
basaltic platform when we arrived at its base we found the stream
bubbling among the fallen blocks for the next twenty-eight miles the
river-course was encumbered with these basaltic masses above that
limit immense fragments of primitive rocks derived from its
surrounding boulder-formation were equally numerous none of the
fragments of any considerable size had been washed more than three or
four miles down the river below their parent-source considering the
singular rapidity of the great body of water in the santa cruz and
that no still reaches occur in any part this example is a most
striking one of the inefficiency of rivers in transporting even
moderately-sized fragments 

the basalt is only lava which has flowed beneath the sea but the
eruptions must have been on the grandest scale at the point where we
first met this formation it was feet in thickness following up the
river course the surface imperceptibly rose and the mass became
thicker so that at forty miles above the first station it was feet
thick what the thickness may be close to the cordillera i have no
means of knowing but the platform there attains a height of about
three thousand feet above the level of the sea we must therefore look
to the mountains of that great chain for its source and worthy of such
a source are streams that have flowed over the gently inclined bed of
the sea to a distance of one hundred miles at the first glance of the
basaltic cliffs on the opposite sides of the valley it was evident
that the strata once were united what power then has removed along
a whole line of country a solid mass of very hard rock which had an
average thickness of nearly three hundred feet and a breadth varying
from rather less than two miles to four miles the river though it
has so little power in transporting even inconsiderable fragments yet
in the lapse of ages might produce by its gradual erosion an effect of
which it is difficult to judge the amount but in this case 
independently of the insignificance of such an agency good reasons can
be assigned for believing that this valley was formerly occupied by an
arm of the sea it is needless in this work to detail the arguments
leading to this conclusion derived from the form and the nature of the
step-formed terraces on both sides of the valley from the manner in
which the bottom of the valley near the andes expands into a great
estuary-like plain with sand-hillocks on it and from the occurrence of
a few sea-shells lying in the bed of the river if i had space i could
prove that south america was formerly here cut off by a strait joining
the atlantic and pacific oceans like that of magellan but it may yet
be asked how has the solid basalt been moved geologists formerly
would have brought into play the violent action of some overwhelming
debacle but in this case such a supposition would have been quite
inadmissible because the same step-like plains with existing
sea-shells lying on their surface which front the long line of the
patagonian coast sweep up on each side of the valley of santa cruz no
possible action of any flood could thus have modelled the land either
within the valley or along the open coast and by the formation of such
step-like plains or terraces the valley itself had been hollowed out 
although we know that there are tides which run within the narrows of
the strait of magellan at the rate of eight knots an hour yet we must
confess that it makes the head almost giddy to reflect on the number of
years century after century which the tides unaided by a heavy surf 
must have required to have corroded so vast an area and thickness of
solid basaltic lava nevertheless we must believe that the strata
undermined by the waters of this ancient strait were broken up into
huge fragments and these lying scattered on the beach were reduced
first to smaller blocks then to pebbles and lastly to the most
impalpable mud which the tides drifted far into the eastern or western
ocean 

with the change in the geological structure of the plains the character
of the landscape likewise altered while rambling up some of the
narrow and rocky defiles i could almost have fancied myself
transported back again to the barren valleys of the island of st jago 
among the basaltic cliffs i found some plants which i had seen nowhere
else but others i recognised as being wanderers from tierra del fuego 
these porous rocks serve as a reservoir for the scanty rain-water and
consequently on the line where the igneous and sedimentary formations
unite some small springs most rare occurrences in patagonia burst
forth and they could be distinguished at a distance by the
circumscribed patches of bright green herbage 

april th the bed of the river became rather narrower and hence the
stream more rapid it here ran at the rate of six knots an hour from
this cause and from the many great angular fragments tracking the
boats became both dangerous and laborious 


this day i shot a condor it measured from tip to tip of the wings 
eight and a half feet and from beak to tail four feet this bird is
known to have a wide geographical range being found on the west coast
of south america from the strait of magellan along the cordillera as
far as eight degrees north of the equator the steep cliff near the
mouth of the rio negro is its northern limit on the patagonian coast 
and they have there wandered about four hundred miles from the great
central line of their habitations in the andes further south among
the bold precipices at the head of port desire the condor is not
uncommon yet only a few stragglers occasionally visit the sea-coast a
line of cliff near the mouth of the santa cruz is frequented by these
birds and about eighty miles up the river where the sides of the
valley are formed by steep basaltic precipices the condor reappears 
from these facts it seems that the condors require perpendicular
cliffs in chile they haunt during the greater part of the year the
lower country near the shores of the pacific and at night several
roost together in one tree but in the early part of summer they
retire to the most inaccessible parts of the inner cordillera there to
breed in peace 

with respect to their propagation i was told by the country people in
chile that the condor makes no sort of nest but in the months of
november and december lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare
rock it is said that the young condors cannot fly for an entire year 
and long after they are able they continue to roost by night and hunt
by day with their parents the old birds generally live in pairs but
among the inland basaltic cliffs of the santa cruz i found a spot 
where scores must usually haunt on coming suddenly to the brow of the
precipice it was a grand spectacle to see between twenty and thirty of
these great birds start heavily from their resting-place and wheel
away in majestic circles from the quantity of dung on the rocks they
must long have frequented this cliff for roosting and breeding having
gorged themselves with carrion on the plains below they retire to
these favourite ledges to digest their food from these facts the
condor like the gallinazo must to a certain degree be considered as a
gregarious bird in this part of the country they live altogether on
the guanacos which have died a natural death or as more commonly
happens have been killed by the pumas i believe from what i saw in
patagonia that they do not on ordinary occasions extend their daily
excursions to any great distance from their regular sleeping-places 

the condors may oftentimes be seen at a great height soaring over a
certain spot in the most graceful circles on some occasions i am sure
that they do this only for pleasure but on others the chileno
countryman tells you that they are watching a dying animal or the puma
devouring its prey if the condors glide down and then suddenly all
rise together the chileno knows that it is the puma which watching
the carcass has sprung out to drive away the robbers besides feeding
on carrion the condors frequently attack young goats and lambs and
the shepherd-dogs are trained whenever they pass over to run out and
looking upwards to bark violently the chilenos destroy and catch
numbers two methods are used one is to place a carcass on a level
piece of ground within an enclosure of sticks with an opening and when
the condors are gorged to gallop up on horseback to the entrance and
thus enclose them for when this bird has not space to run it cannot
give its body sufficient momentum to rise from the ground the second
method is to mark the trees in which frequently to the number of five
or six together they roost and they at night to climb up and noose
them they are such heavy sleepers as i have myself witnessed that
this is not a difficult task at valparaiso i have seen a living
condor sold for sixpence but the common price is eight or ten
shillings one which i saw brought in had been tied with rope and was
much injured yet the moment the line was cut by which its bill was
secured although surrounded by people it began ravenously to tear a
piece of carrion in a garden at the same place between twenty and
thirty were kept alive they were fed only once a week but they
appeared in pretty good health the chileno countrymen assert that
the condor will live and retain its vigour between five and six weeks
without eating i cannot answer for the truth of this but it is a
cruel experiment which very likely has been tried 

when an animal is killed in the country it is well known that the
condors like other carrion-vultures soon gain intelligence of it and
congregate in an inexplicable manner in most cases it must not be
overlooked that the birds have discovered their prey and have picked
the skeleton clean before the flesh is in the least degree tainted 
remembering the experiments of m audubon on the little smelling
powers of carrion-hawks i tried in the above mentioned garden the
following experiment the condors were tied each by a rope in a long
row at the bottom of a wall and having folded up a piece of meat in
white paper i walked backwards and forwards carrying it in my hand at
the distance of about three yards from them but no notice whatever was
taken i then threw it on the ground within one yard of an old male
bird he looked at it for a moment with attention but then regarded it
no more with a stick i pushed it closer and closer until at last he
touched it with his beak the paper was then instantly torn off with
fury and at the same moment every bird in the long row began
struggling and flapping its wings under the same circumstances it
would have been quite impossible to have deceived a dog the evidence
in favour of and against the acute smelling powers of carrion-vultures
is singularly balanced professor owen has demonstrated that the
olfactory nerves of the turkey-buzzard cathartes aura are highly
developed and on the evening when mr owen s paper was read at the
zoological society it was mentioned by a gentleman that he had seen
the carrion-hawks in the west indies on two occasions collect on the
roof of a house when a corpse had become offensive from not having
been buried in this case the intelligence could hardly have been
acquired be sight on the other hand besides the experiments of
audubon and that one by myself mr bachman has tried in the united
states many varied plans showing that neither the turkey-buzzard the
species dissected by professor owen nor the gallinazo find their food
by smell he covered portions of highly-offensive offal with a thin
canvas cloth and strewed pieces of meat on it these the
carrion-vultures ate up and then remained quietly standing with their
beaks within the eighth of an inch of the putrid mass without
discovering it a small rent was made in the canvas and the offal was
immediately discovered the canvas was replaced by a fresh piece and
meat again put on it and was again devoured by the vultures without
their discovering the hidden mass on which they were trampling these
facts are attested by the signatures of six gentlemen besides that of
mr bachman 

often when lying down to rest on the open plains on looking upwards i
have seen carrion-hawks sailing through the air at a great height 
where the country is level i do not believe a space of the heavens of
more than fifteen degrees above the horizon is commonly viewed with
any attention by a person either walking or on horseback if such be
the case and the vulture is on the wing at a height of between three
and four thousand feet before it could come within the range of
vision its distance in a straight line from the beholder s eye would
be rather more than two british miles might it not thus readily be
overlooked when an animal is killed by the sportsman in a lonely
valley may he not all the while be watched from above by the
sharp-sighted bird and will not the manner of its descend proclaim
throughout the district to the whole family of carrion-feeders that
their prey is at hand 

when the condors are wheeling in a flock round and round any spot 
their flight is beautiful except when rising from the ground i do
not recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings near
lima i watched several for nearly half an hour without once taking
off my eyes they moved in large curves sweeping in circles 
descending and ascending without giving a single flap as they glided
close over my head i intently watched from an oblique position the
outlines of the separate and great terminal feathers of each wing and
these separate feathers if there had been the least vibratory
movement would have appeared as if blended together but they were
seen distinct against the blue sky the head and neck were moved
frequently and apparently with force and the extended wings seemed to
form the fulcrum on which the movements of the neck body and tail
acted if the bird wished to descend the wings were for a moment
collapsed and when again expanded with an altered inclination the
momentum gained by the rapid descent seemed to urge the bird upwards
with the even and steady movement of a paper kite in the case of any
bird soaring its motion must be sufficiently rapid so that the action
of the inclined surface of its body on the atmosphere may
counterbalance its gravity the force to keep up the momentum of a
body moving in a horizontal plane in the air in which there is so
little friction cannot be great and this force is all that is wanted 
the movements of the neck and body of the condor we must suppose is
sufficient for this however this may be it is truly wonderful and
beautiful to see so great a bird hour after hour without any apparent
exertion wheeling and gliding over mountain and river 

april th from some high land we hailed with joy the white summits
of the cordillera as they were seen occasionally peeping through their
dusky envelope of clouds during the few succeeding days we continued
to get on slowly for we found the river-course very tortuous and
strewed with immense fragments of various ancient slate rocks and of
granite the plain bordering the valley has here attained an elevation
of about feet above the river and its character was much altered 
the well-rounded pebbles of porphyry were mingled with many immense
angular fragments of basalt and of primary rocks the first of these
erratic boulders which i noticed was sixty-seven miles distant from
the nearest mountain another which i measured was five yards square 
and projected five feet above the gravel its edges were so angular 
and its size so great that i at first mistook it for a rock in situ 
and took out my compass to observe the direction of its cleavage the
plain here was not quite so level as that nearer the coast but yet in
betrayed no signs of any great violence under these circumstances it
is i believe quite impossible to explain the transportal of these
gigantic masses of rock so many miles from their parent-source on any
theory except by that of floating icebergs 

during the two last days we met with signs of horses and with several
small articles which had belonged to the indians such as parts of a
mantle and a bunch of ostrich feathers but they appeared to have
been lying long on the ground between the place where the indians had
so lately crossed the river and this neighbourhood though so many
miles apart the country appears to be quite unfrequented at first 
considering the abundance of the guanacos i was surprised at this but
it is explained by the stony nature of the plains which would soon
disable an unshod horse from taking part in the chase nevertheless 
in two places in this very central region i found small heaps of
stones which i do not think could have been accidentally thrown
together they were placed on points projecting over the edge of the
highest lava cliff and they resembled but on a small scale those
near port desire 

may th captain fitz roy determined to take the boats no higher the
river had a winding course and was very rapid and the appearance of
the country offered no temptation to proceed any further everywhere we
met with the same productions and the same dreary landscape we were
now one hundred and forty miles distant from the atlantic and about
sixty from the nearest arm of the pacific the valley in this upper
part expanded into a wide basin bounded on the north and south by the
basaltic platforms and fronted by the long range of the snow-clad
cordillera but we viewed these grand mountains with regret for we
were obliged to imagine their nature and productions instead of
standing as we had hoped on their summits besides the useless loss
of time which an attempt to ascend the river and higher would have cost
us we had already been for some days on half allowance of bread this 
although really enough for reasonable men was after a hard day s
march rather scanty food a light stomach and an easy digestion are
good things to talk about but very unpleasant in practice 

th before sunrise we commenced our descent we shot down the stream
with great rapidity generally at the rate of ten knots an hour in
this one day we effected what had cost us five-and-a-half hard days 
labour in ascending on the th we reached the beagle after our
twenty-one days expedition every one excepting myself had cause to
be dissatisfied but to me the ascent afforded a most interesting
section of the great tertiary formation of patagonia 

on march st and again on march th the beagle anchored
in berkeley sound in east falkland island this archipelago is
situated in nearly the same latitude with the mouth of the strait of
magellan it covers a space of one hundred and twenty by sixty
geographical miles and is little more than half the size of ireland 
after the possession of these miserable islands had been contested by
france spain and england they were left uninhabited the government
of buenos ayres then sold them to a private individual but likewise
used them as old spain had done before for a penal settlement 
england claimed her right and seized them the englishman who was left
in charge of the flag was consequently murdered a british officer was
next sent unsupported by any power and when we arrived we found him
in charge of a population of which rather more than half were runaway
rebels and murderers 

the theatre is worthy of the scenes acted on it an undulating land 
with a desolate and wretched aspect is everywhere covered by a peaty
soil and wiry grass of one monotonous brown colour here and there a
peak or ridge of grey quartz rock breaks through the smooth surface
every one has heard of the climate of these regions it may be compared
to that which is experienced at the height of between one and two
thousand feet on the mountains of north wales having however less
sunshine and less frost but more wind and rain 

th i will now describe a short excursion which made round a part of
this island in the morning i started with six horses and two gauchos 
the latter were capital men for the purpose and well accustomed to
living on their own resources the weather was very boisterous and
cold with heavy hail-storms we got on however pretty well but 
except the geology nothing could be less interesting than our day s
ride the country is uniformly the same undulating moorland the
surface being covered by light brown withered grass and a few very
small shrubs all springing out of an elastic peaty soil in the
valleys here and there might be seen a small flock of wild geese and
everywhere the ground was so soft that the snipe were able to feed 
besides these two birds there were few others there is one main range
of hills nearly two thousand feet in height and composed of quartz
rock the rugged and barren crests of which gave us some trouble to
cross on the south side we came to the best country for wild cattle 
we met however no great number for they had been lately much
harassed 

in the evening we came across a small herd one of my companions st 
jago by name soon separated a fat cow he threw the bolas and it
struck her legs but failed in becoming entangled then dropping his
hat to mark the spot where the balls were left while at full gallop 
he uncoiled his lazo and after a most severe chase again came up to
the cow and caught her round the horns the other gaucho had gone on
ahead with the spare horses so that st jago had some difficulty in
killing the furious beast he managed to get her on a level piece of
ground by taking advantage of her as often as she rushed at him and
when she would not move my horse from having been trained would
canter up and with his chest give her a violent push but when on
level ground it does not appear an easy job for one man to kill a beast
mad with terror nor would it be so if the horse when left to itself
without its rider did not soon learn for its own safety to keep the
lazo tight so that if the cow or ox moves forward the horse moves
just as quickly forward otherwise it stands motionless leaning on one
side this horse however was a young one and would not stand still 
but gave in to the cow as she struggled it was admirable to see with
what dexterity st jago dodged behind the beast till at last he
contrived to give the fatal touch to the main tendon of the hind leg
after which without much difficulty he drove his knife into the head
of the spinal marrow and the cow dropped as if struck by lightning he
cut off pieces of flesh with the skin to it but without any bones 
sufficient for our expedition we then rode on to our sleeping-place 
and had for supper carne con cuero or meat roasted with the skin on
it this is as superior to common beef as venison is to mutton a
large circular piece taken from the back is roasted on the embers with
the hide downwards and is the form of a saucer so that none of the
gravy is lost if any worthy alderman had supped with us that evening 
 carne con cuero without doubt would soon have been celebrated in
london 

during the night it rained and the next day th was very stormy 
with much hail and snow we rode across the island to the neck of land
which joins the rincon del toro the great peninsula at the s w 
extremity to the rest of the island from the great number of cows
which have been killed there is a large proportion of bulls these
wander about single or two and three together and are very savage i
never saw such magnificent beasts they equalled in the size of their
huge heads and necks the grecian marble sculptures capt sulivan
informs me that the hide of an average-sized bull weighs forty-seven
pounds whereas a hide of this weight less thoroughly dried is
considered as a very heavy one at monte video the young bulls
generally run away for a short distance but the old ones do not stir
a step except to rush at man and horse and many horses have been thus
killed an old bull crossed a boggy stream and took his stand on the
opposite side to us we in vain tried to drive him away and failing 
were obliged to make a large circuit the gauchos in revenge
determined to emasculate him and render him for the future harmless it
was very interesting to see how art completely mastered force one
lazo was thrown over his horns as he rushed at the horse and another
round his hind legs in a minute the monster was stretched powerless on
the ground after the lazo has once been drawn tightly round the horns
of a furious animal it does not at first appear an easy thing to
disengage it again without killing the beast nor i apprehend would
it be so if the man was by himself by the aid however of a second
person throwing his lazo so as to catch both hind legs it is quickly
managed for the animal as long as its hind legs are kept
outstretched is quite helpless and the first man can with his hands
loosen his lazo from the horns and then quietly mount his horse but
the moment the second man by backing ever so little relaxes the
strain the lazo slips off the legs of the struggling beast which then
rises free shakes himself and vainly rushes at his antagonist 

during our whole ride we saw only one troop of wild horses these
animals as well as the cattle were introduced by the french in 
since which time both have greatly increased it is a curious fact 
that the horses have never left the eastern end of the island although
there is no natural boundary to prevent them from roaming and that
part of the island is not more tempting than the rest the gauchos
whom i asked though asserting this to be the case were unable to
account for it except from the strong attachment which horses have to
any locality to which they are accustomed considering that the island
does not appear fully stocked and that there are no beasts of prey i
was particularly curious to know what has checked their originally
rapid increase that in a limited island some check would sooner or
later supervene is inevitable but why had the increase of the horse
been checked sooner than that of the cattle capt sulivan has taken
much pains for me in this inquiry the gauchos employed here attribute
it chiefly to the stallions constantly roaming from place to place and
compelling the mares to accompany them whether or not the young foals
are able to follow one gaucho told capt sulivan that he had watched
a stallion for a whole hour violently kicking and biting a mare till
he forced her to leave her foal to its fate capt sulivan can so far
corroborate this curious account that he has several times found young
foals dead whereas he has never found a dead calf moreover the dead
bodies of full-grown horses are more frequently found as if more
subject to disease or accidents than those of the cattle from the
softness of the ground their hoofs often grow irregularly to a great
length and this causes lameness the predominant colours are roan and
iron-grey all the horses bred here both tame and wild are rather
small-sized though generally in good condition and they have lost so
much strength that they are unfit to be used in taking wild cattle
with the lazo in consequence it is necessary to go to the great
expense of importing fresh horses from the plata at some future
period the southern hemisphere probably will have its breed of falkland
ponies as the northern has its shetland breed 

the cattle instead of having degenerated like the horses seem as
before remarked to have increased in size and they are much more
numerous than the horses capt sulivan informs me that they vary much
less in the general form of their bodies and in the shape of their
horns than english cattle in colour they differ much and it is a
remarkable circumstance that in different parts of this one small
island different colours predominate round mount usborne at a
height of from to feet above the sea about half of some of
the herds are mouse or lead-coloured a tint which is not common in
other parts of the island near port pleasant dark brown prevails 
whereas south of choiseul sound which almost divides the island into
two parts white beasts with black heads and feet are the most common 
in all parts black and some spotted animals may be observed capt 
sulivan remarks that the difference in the prevailing colours was so
obvious that in looking for the herds near port pleasant they
appeared from a long distance like black spots whilst south of
choiseul sound they appeared like white spots on the hill-sides capt 
sulivan thinks that the herds do not mingle and it is a singular fact 
that the mouse-coloured cattle though living on the high land calve
about a month earlier in the season that the other coloured beasts on
the lower land it is interesting thus to find the once domesticated
cattle breaking into three colours of which some one colour would in
all probability ultimately prevail over the others if the herds were
left undisturbed for the next several centuries 

the rabbit is another animal which has been introduced and has
succeeded very well so that they abound over large parts of the
island yet like the horses they are confined within certain limits 
for they have not crossed the central chain of hills nor would they
have extended even so far as its base if as the gauchos informed me 
small colonies has not been carried there i should not have supposed
that these animals natives of northern africa could have existed in a
climate so humid as this and which enjoys so little sunshine that even
wheat ripens only occasionally it is asserted that in sweden which
any one would have thought a more favourable climate the rabbit cannot
live out of doors the first few pairs moreover had here to content
against pre-existing enemies in the fox and some large hawks the
french naturalists have considered the black variety a distinct
species and called it lepus magellanicus they imagined that
magellan when talking of an animal under the name of conejos in the
strait of magellan referred to this species but he was alluding to a
small cavy which to this day is thus called by the spaniards the
gauchos laughed at the idea of the black kind being different from the
grey and they said that at all events it had not extended its range
any further than the grey kind that the two were never found separate 
and that they readily bred together and produced piebald offspring of
the latter i now possess a specimen and it is marked about the head
differently from the french specific description this circumstance
shows how cautious naturalists should be in making species for even
cuvier on looking at the skull of one of these rabbits thought it was
probably distinct 

the only quadruped native to the island is a large wolf-like fox
 canis antarcticus which is common to both east and west falkland i
have no doubt it is a peculiar species and confined to this
archipelago because many sealers gauchos and indians who have
visited these islands all maintain that no such animal is found in any
part of south america 

molina from a similarity in habits thought that this was the same
with his culpeu but i have seen both and they are quite
distinct these wolves are well known from byron s account of their
tameness and curiosity which the sailors who ran into the water to
avoid them mistook for fierceness to this day their manners remain
the same they have been observed to enter a tent and actually pull
some meat from beneath the head of a sleeping seaman the gauchos also
have frequently in the evening killed them by holding out a piece of
meat in one hand and in the other a knife ready to stick them as far
as i am aware there is no other instance in any part of the world of
so small a mass of broken land distant from a continent possessing so
large an aboriginal quadruped peculiar to itself their numbers have
rapidly decreased they are already banished from that half of the
island which lies to the eastward of the neck of land between st 
salvador bay and berkeley sound within a very few years after these
islands shall have become regularly settled in all probability this
for will be classed with the dodo as an animal which has perished from
the face of the earth 

at night th we slept on the neck of land at the head of choiseul
sound which forms the south-west peninsula the valley was pretty well
sheltered from the cold wind but there was very little brushwood for
fuel the gauchos however soon found what to my great surprise 
made nearly as hot a fire as coals this was the skeleton of a bullock
lately killed from which the flesh had been picked by the
carrion-hawks they told me that in winter they often killed a beast 
cleaned the flesh from the bones with their knives and then with these
same bones roasted the meat for their suppers 

th it rained during nearly the whole day at night we managed 
however with our saddle-cloths to keep ourselves pretty well dry and
warm but the ground on which we slept was on each occasion nearly in
the state of a bog and there was not a dry spot to sit down on after
our day s ride i have in another part stated how singular it is that
there should be absolutely no trees on these islands although tierra
del fuego is covered by one large forest the largest bush in the
island belonging to the family of compositae is scarcely so tall as
our gorse the best fuel is afforded by a green little bush about the
size of common heath which has the useful property of burning while
fresh and green it was very surprising to see the gauchos in the
midst of rain and everything soaking wet with nothing more than a
tinder-box and a piece of rag immediately make a fire they sought
beneath the tufts of grass and bushel for a few dry twigs and these
they rubbed into fibres then surrounding them with coarser twigs 
something like a bird s nest they put the rag with its spark of fire
in the middle and covered it up the nest being then held up to the
wind by degrees it smoked more and more and at last burst out in
flames i do not think any other method would have had a chance of
succeeding with such damp materials 

th each morning from not having ridden for some time previously i
was very stiff i was surprised to hear the gauchos who have from
infancy almost lived on horseback say that under similar
circumstances they always suffer st jago told me that having been
confined for three months by illness he went out hunting wild cattle 
and in consequence for the next two days his thighs were so stiff
that he was obliged to lie in bed this shows that the gauchos 
although they do not appear to do so yet really must exert much
muscular effort in riding the hunting wild cattle in a country so
difficult to pass as this is on account of the swampy ground must be
very hard work the gauchos say they often pass at full speed over
ground which would be impassable at a slower pace in the same manner
as a man is able to skate over thin ice when hunting the party
endeavours to get as close as possible to the herd without being
discovered each man carries four or five pair of the bolas these he
throws one after the other at as many cattle which when once
entangled are left for some days till they become a little exhausted
by hunger and struggling they are then let free and driven towards a
small herd of tame animals which have been brought to the spot on
purpose from their previous treatment being too much terrified to
leave the herd they are easily driven if their strength last out to
the settlement 

the weather continued so very bad that we determine to make a push and
try to reach the vessel before night from the quantity of rain which
had fallen the surface of the whole country was swampy i suppose my
horse fell at least a dozen times and sometimes the whole six horses
were floundering in the mud together all the little streams are
bordered by soft peat which makes it very difficult for the horses to
leap them without falling to complete our discomforts we were obliged
to cross the head of a creek of the sea in which the water was as high
as our horses backs and the little waves owing to the violence of
the wind broke over us and made us very wet and cold even the
iron-framed gauchos professed themselves glad when they reached the
settlement after our little excursion 

the geological structure of these islands is in most respects simple 
the lower country consists of clay-slate and sandstone containing
fossils very closely related to but not identical with those found
in the silurian formations of europe the hills are formed of white
granular quartz rock the strata of the latter are frequently arched
with perfect symmetry and the appearance of some of the masses is in
consequence most singular pernety has devoted several pages to
the description of a hill of ruins the successive strata of which he
has justly compared to the seats of an amphitheatre the quartz rock
must have been quite pasty when it underwent such remarkable flexures
without being shattered into fragments as the quartz insensibly
passes into the sandstone it seems probable that the former owes its
origin to the sandstone having been heated to such a degree that it
became viscid and upon cooling crystallized while in the soft state
it must have been pushed up through the overlying beds 

in many parts of the island the bottoms of the valleys are covered in
an extraordinary manner by myriads of great loose angular fragments of
the quartz rock forming streams of stones these have been mentioned
with surprise by every voyager since the time of pernety the blocks
are not water-worn their angles being only a little blunted they vary
in size from one or two feet in diameter to ten or even more than
twenty times as much they are not thrown together into irregular
piles but are spread out into level sheets or great streams it is
not possible to ascertain their thickness but the water of small
streamlets can be heard trickling through the stones many feet below
the surface the actual depth is probably great because the crevices
between the lower fragments must long ago have been filled up with
sand the width of these sheets of stones varied from a few hundred
feet to a mile but the peaty soil daily encroaches on the borders and
even forms islets wherever a few fragments happen to lie close
together in a valley south of berkeley sound which some of our party
called the great valley of fragments it was necessary to cross an
uninterrupted band half a mile wide by jumping from one pointed stone
to another so large were the fragments that being overtaken by a
shower of rain i readily found shelter beneath one of them 

their little inclination is the most remarkable circumstance in these
 streams of stones on the hill-sides i have seen them sloping at an
angle of ten degrees with the horizon but in some of the level 
broad-bottomed valleys the inclination is only just sufficient to be
clearly perceived on so rugged a surface there was no means of
measuring the angle but to give a common illustration i may say that
the slope would not have checked the speed of an english mail-coach in
some places a continuous stream of these fragments followed up the
course of a valley and even extended to the very crest of the hill on
these crests huge masses exceeding in dimensions any small building 
seemed to stand arrested in their headlong course there also the
curved strata of the archways lay piled on each other like the ruins
of some vast and ancient cathedral in endeavouring to describe these
scenes of violence one is tempted to pass from one simile to another 
we may imagine that streams of white lava had flowed from many parts of
the mountains into the lower country and that when solidified they had
been rent by some enormous convulsion into myriads of fragments the
expression streams of stones which immediately occurred to every
one conveys the same idea these scenes are on the spot rendered more
striking by the contrast of the low rounded forms of the neighbouring
hills 

i was interested by finding on the highest peak of one range about 
feet above the sea a great arched fragment lying on its convex side 
or back downwards must we believe that it was fairly pitched up in
the air and thus turned or with more probability that there
existed formerly a part of the same range more elevated than the point
on which this monument of a great convulsion of nature now lies as
the fragments in the valleys are neither rounded nor the crevices
filled up with sand we must infer that the period of violence was
subsequent to the land having been raised above the waters of the sea 
in a transverse section within these valleys the bottom is nearly
level or rises but very little towards either side hence the
fragments appear to have travelled from the head of the valley but in
reality it seems more probable that they have been hurled down from the
nearest slopes and that since by a vibratory movement of overwhelming
force the fragments have been levelled into one continuous sheet 
if during the earthquake which in overthrew concepcion in
chile it was thought wonderful that small bodies should have been
pitched a few inches from the ground what must we say to a movement
which has caused fragments many tons in weight to move onwards like so
much sand on a vibrating board and find their level i have seen in
the cordillera of the andes the evident marks where stupendous
mountains have been broken into pieces like so much thin crust and the
strata thrown of their vertical edges but never did any scene like
these streams of stones so forcibly convey to my mind the idea of a
convulsion of which in historical records we might in vain seek for
any counterpart yet the progress of knowledge will probably some day
give a simple explanation of this phenomenon as it already has of the
so long-thought inexplicable transportal of the erratic boulders which
are strewed over the plains of europe 

i have little to remark on the zoology of these islands have before
described the carrion-vulture of polyborus there are some other hawks 
owls and a few small land-birds the water-fowl are particularly
numerous and they must formerly from the accounts of the old
navigators have been much more so one day i observed a cormorant
playing with a fish which it had caught eight times successively the
bird let its prey go then dived after it and although in deep water 
brought it each time to the surface in the zoological gardens i have
seen the otter treat a fish in the same manner much as a cat does a
mouse i do not know of any other instance where dame nature appears so
wilfully cruel another day having placed myself between a penguin
 aptenodytes demersa and the water i was much amused by watching its
habits it was a brave bird and till reaching the sea it regularly
fought and drove me backwards nothing less than heavy blows would have
stopped him every inch he gained he firmly kept standing close before
me erect and determined when thus opposed he continually rolled his
head from side to side in a very odd manner as if the power of
distinct vision lay only in the anterior and basal part of each eye 
this bird is commonly called the jackass penguin from its habit while
on shore of throwing its head backwards and making a loud strange
noise very like the braying of an ass but while at sea and
undisturbed its note is very deep and solemn and is often heard in
the night-time in diving its little wings are used as fins but on
the land as front legs when crawling it may be said on four legs 
through the tussocks or on the side of a grassy cliff it moves so very
quickly that it might easily be mistaken for a quadruped when at sea
and fishing it comes to the surface for the purpose of breathing with
such a spring and dives again so instantaneously that i defy any one
at first sight to be sure that it was not a fish leaping for sport 

two kinds of geese frequent the falklands the upland species anas
magellanica is common in pairs and in small flocks throughout the
island they do not migrate but build on the small outlying islets 
this is supposed to be from fear of the foxes and it is perhaps from
the same cause that these birds though very tame by day are shy and
wild in the dusk of the evening they live entirely on vegetable
matter 

the rock-goose so called from living exclusively on the sea-beach
 anas antarctica is common both here and on the west coast of
america as far north as chile in the deep and retired channels of
tierra del fuego the snow-white gander invariably accompanied by his
darker consort and standing close by each other on some distant rocky
point is a common feature in the landscape 

in these islands a great loggerheaded duck or goose anas brachyptera 
which sometimes weighs twenty-two pounds is very abundant these
birds were in former days called from their extraordinary manner of
paddling and splashing upon the water race-horses but now they are
named much more appropriately steamers their wings are too small
and weak to allow of flight but by their aid partly swimming and
partly flapping the surface of the water they move very quickly the
manner is something like that by which the common house-duck escapes
when pursued by a dog but i am nearly sure that the steamer moves its
wings alternately instead of both together as in other birds these
clumsy loggerheaded ducks make such a noise and splashing that the
effect is exceedingly curious 

thus we find in south america three birds which use their wings for
other purposes besides flight the penguins as fins the steamer as
paddles and the ostrich as sails and the apteryz of new zealand as
well as its gigantic extinct prototype the deinornis possess only
rudimentary representatives of wings the steamer is able to dive only
to a very short distance it feeds entirely on shell-fish from the
kelp and tidal rocks hence the beak and head for the purpose of
breaking them are surprisingly heavy and strong the head is so strong
that i have scarcely been able to fracture it with my geological
hammer and all our sportsmen soon discovered how tenacious these birds
were of life when in the evening pluming themselves in a flock they
make the same odd mixture of sounds which bull-frogs do within the
tropics 

in tierra del fuego as well as in the falkland islands made many
observations on the lower marine animals but they are of little
general interest i will mention only one class of facts relating to
certain zoophytes in the more highly organized division of that class 
several genera flustra eschara cellaria crisia and others agree
in having singular moveable organs like those of flustra avicularia 
found in the european seas attached to their cells the organ in the
greater number of cases very closely resembles the head of a vulture 
but the lower mandible can be opened much wider than in a real bird s
beak the head itself possessed considerable powers of movement by
means of a short neck in one zoophyte the head itself was fixed but
the lower jaw free in another it was replaced by a triangular hood 
with beautifully-fitted trap-door which evidently answered to the
lower mandible in the greater number of species each cell was
provided with one head but in others each cell had two 

the young cells at the end of the branches of these corallines contain
quite immature polypi yet the vulture-head attached to them though
small are in every respect perfect when the polypus was removed by a
needle from any of the cells these organs did not appear in the least
affected when one of the vulture-like heads was cut off from the
cell the lower mandible retained its power of opening and closing 
perhaps the most singular part of their structure is that when there
were more than two rows of cells on a branch the central cells were
furnished with these appendages of only one-fourth the size of the
outside ones their movements varied according to the species but in
some i never saw the least motion while others with the lower
mandible generally wide open oscillated backwards and forwards at the
rate of about five seconds each turn others moved rapidly and by
starts when touched with a needle the beak generally seized the
point so firmly that the whole branch might be shaken 

these bodies have no relation whatever with the production of the eggs
or gemmules as they are formed before the young polypi appear in the
cells at the end of the growing branches as they move independently of
the polypi and do not appear to be in any way connected with them and
as they differ in size on the outer and inner rows of cells i have
little doubt that in their functions they are related rather to the
horny axis of the branches than to the polypi in the cells the fleshy
appendage at the lower extremity of the sea-pen described at bahia
blanca also forms part of the zoophyte as a whole in the same manner
as the roots of a tree form part of the whole tree and not of the
individual leaf or flower-buds 

in another elegant little coralline crisia each cell was furnished
with a long-toothed bristle which had the power of moving quickly 
each of these bristles and each of the vulture-like heads generally
moved quite independently of the others but sometimes all on both
sides of a branch sometimes only those on one side moved together
coinstantaneously sometimes each moved in regular order one after
another in these actions we apparently behold as perfect a
transmission of will in the zoophyte though composed of thousands of
distinct polypi as in any single animal the case indeed is not
different from that of the sea-pens which when touched drew
themselves into the sand on the coast of bahia blanca i will state
one other instance of uniform action though of a very different
nature in a zoophyte closely allied to clytia and therefore very
simply organized having kept a large tuft of it in a basin of
salt-water when it was dark i found that as often as i rubbed any part
of a branch the whole became strongly phosphorescent with a green
light i do not think i ever saw any object more beautifully so but
the remarkable circumstance was that the flashes of light always
proceeded up the branches from the base towards the extremities 

the examination of these compound animals was always very interesting
to me what can be more remarkable that to see a plant-like body
producing an egg capable of swimming about and of choosing a proper
place to adhere to which then sprouts into branches each crowded with
innumerable distinct animals often of complicated organizations the
branches moreover as we have just seen sometimes possess organs
capable of movement and independent of the polypi surprising as this
union of separate individuals in common stock must always appear every
tree displays the same fact for buds must be considered as individual
plants it is however natural to consider a polypus furnished with a
mouth intestines and other organs as a distinct individual whereas
the individuality of a leaf-bud is not easily realised so that the
union of separate individuals in a common body is more striking in a
coralline than in a tree our conception of a compound animal where
in some respects the individuality of each is not completed may be
aided by reflecting on the production of two distinct creatures by
bisecting a single one with a knife or where nature herself performs
the task of bisection we may consider the polypi in a zoophyte or
the buds in a tree as cases where the division of the individual has
not been completely effected certainly in the case of trees and
judging from analogy in that of corallines the individuals propagated
by buds seem more intimately related to each other than eggs or seeds
are to their parents it seems now pretty well established that plants
propagated by buds all partake of a common duration of life and it is
familiar to every one what singular and numerous peculiarities are
transmitted with certainty by buds layers and grafts which by
seminal propagation never or only casually reappear

all the lice with which it was infested crawled to the outside
feathers i was assured that this always happens 

 london s magazine of nat hist vol vii 

 from accounts published since our voyage and more especially from
several interesting letters from capt sulivan r n employed on the
survey it appears that we took an exaggerated view of the badness of
the climate on these islands but when i reflect on the almost
universal covering of peat and on the fact of wheat seldom ripening
here i can hardly believe that the climate in summer is so fine and
dry as it has lately been represented 

 lesson s zoology of the voyage of the coquille tom i p all
the early voyagers and especially bougainville distinctly state that
the wolf-like fox was the only native animal on the island the
distinction of the rabbit as a species is taken from peculiarities in
the fur from the shape of the head and from the shortness of the
ears i may here observe that the difference between the irish and
english hare rests upon nearly similar characters only more strongly
marked 

 i have reason however to suspect that there is a field-mouse the
common european rat and mouse have roamed far from the habitations of
the settlers the common hog has also run wild on one islet all are
of a black colour the boars are very fierce and have great trunks

 an inhabitant of mendoza and hence well capable of judging

islands he had never felt the slightest shock of an earthquake 

 i was surprised to find on counting the eggs of a large white
doris this sea-slug was three and a half inches long how
extraordinarily numerous they were from two to five eggs each
three-thousandths of an inch in diameter were contained in spherical
little case these were arranged two deep in transverse rows forming a
ribbon the ribbon adhered by its edge to the rock in an oval spire 
one which i found measured nearly twenty inches in length and half in
breadth by counting how many balls were contained in a tenth of an
inch in the row and how many rows in an equal length of the ribbon on
the most moderate computation there were six hundred thousand eggs yet
this doris was certainly not very common although i was often
searching under the stones i saw only seven individuals no fallacy
is more common with naturalists than that the numbers of an individual
species depend on its powers of propagation

fuegians on board interview with the savages scenery of the
forests cape horn wigwam cove miserable condition of the
savages famines cannibals matricide religious feelings great
gale beagle channel ponsonby sound build wigwams and settle the
fuegians bifurcation of the beagle channel glaciers return to the
ship second visit in the ship to the settlement equality of condition
amongst the natives 


december th having now finished with patagonia and the
falkland islands i will describe our first arrival in tierra del
fuego a little after noon we doubled cape st diego and entered the
famous strait of le maire we kept close to the fuegian shore but the
outline of the rugged inhospitable statenland was visible amidst the
clouds in the afternoon we anchored in the bay of good success while
entering we were saluted in a manner becoming the inhabitants of this
savage land a group of fuegians partly concealed by the entangled
forest were perched on a wild point overhanging the sea and as we
passed by they sprang up and waving their tattered cloaks sent forth a
loud and sonorous shout the savages followed the ship and just
before dark we saw their fire and again heard their wild cry the
harbour consists of a fine piece of water half surrounded by low
rounded mountains of clay-slate which are covered to the water s edge
by one dense gloomy forest a single glance at the landscape was
sufficient to show me how widely different it was from anything i had
ever beheld at night it blew a gale of wind and heavy squalls from
the mountains swept past us it would have been a bad time out at sea 
and we as well as others may call this good success bay 

in the morning the captain sent a party to communicate with the
fuegians when we came within hail one of the four natives who were
present advanced to receive us and began to shout most vehemently 
wishing to direct us where to land when we were on shore the party
looked rather alarmed but continued talking and making gestures with
great rapidity it was without exception the most curious and
interesting spectacle i ever beheld i could not have believed how wide
was the difference between savage and civilized man it is greater than
between a wild and domesticated animal inasmuch as in man there is a
greater power of improvement the chief spokesman was old and
appeared to be the head of the family the three others were powerful
young men about six feet high the women and children had been sent
away these fuegians are a very different race from the stunted 
miserable wretches farther westward and they seem closely allied to
the famous patagonians of the strait of magellan their only garment
consists of a mantle made of guanaco skin with the wool outside this
they wear just thrown over their shoulders leaving their persons as
often exposed as covered their skin is of a dirty coppery-red colour 

the old man had a fillet of white feathers tied round his head which
partly confined his black coarse and entangled hair his face was
crossed by two broad transverse bars one painted bright red reached
from ear to ear and included the upper lip the other white like
chalk extended above and parallel to the first so that even his
eyelids were thus coloured the other two men were ornamented by
streaks of black powder made of charcoal the party altogether
closely resembled the devils which come on the stage in plays like der
freischutz 

their very attitudes were abject and the expression of their
countenances distrustful surprised and startled after we had
presented them with some scarlet cloth which they immediately tied
round their necks they became good friends this was shown by the old
man patting our breasts and making a chuckling kind of noise as
people do when feeding chickens i walked with the old man and this
demonstration of friendship was repeated several times it was
concluded by three hard slaps which were given me on the breast and
back at the same time he then bared his bosom for me to return the
compliment which being done he seemed highly pleased the language
of these people according to our notions scarcely deserves to be
called articulate captain cook has compared it to a man clearing his
throat but certainly no european ever cleared his throat with so many
hoarse guttural and clicking sounds 

they are excellent mimics as often as we coughed or yawned or made
any odd motion they immediately imitated us some of our party began
to squint and look awry but one of the young fuegians whose whole
face was painted black excepting a white band across his eyes 
succeeded in making far more hideous grimaces they could repeat with
perfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them and
they remembered such words for some time yet we europeans all know
how difficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign
language which of us for instance could follow an american indian
through a sentence of more than three words all savages appear to
possess to an uncommon degree this power of mimicry i was told 
almost in the same words of the same ludicrous habit among the
caffres the australians likewise have long been notorious for being
able to imitate and describe the gait of any man so that he may be
recognized how can this faculty be explained is it a consequence of
the more practised habits of perception and keener senses common to
all men in a savage state as compared with those long civilized 

when a song was struck up by our party i thought the fuegians would
have fallen down with astonishment with equal surprise they viewed
our dancing but one of the young men when asked had no objection to
a little waltzing little accustomed to europeans as they appeared to
be yet they knew and dreaded our fire-arms nothing would tempt them
to take a gun in their hands they begged for knives calling them by
the spanish word cuchilla they explained also what they wanted by
acting as if they had a piece of blubber in their mouth and then
pretending to cut instead of tear it 

i have not as yet noticed the fuegians whom we had on board during
the former voyage of the adventure and beagle in to captain
fitz roy seized on a party of natives as hostages for the loss of a
boat which had been stolen to the great jeopardy of a party employed
on the survey and some of these natives as well as a child whom he
bought for a pearl-button he took with him to england determining to
educate them and instruct them in religion at his own expense to
settle these natives in their own country was one chief inducement to
captain fitz roy to undertake our present voyage and before the
admiralty had resolved to send out this expedition captain fitz roy
had generously chartered a vessel and would himself have taken them
back the natives were accompanied by a missionary r matthews of
whom and of the natives captain fitz roy has published a full and
excellent account two men one of whom died in england of the
small-pox a boy and a little girl were originally taken and we had
now on board york minster jemmy button whose name expresses his
purchase-money and fuegia basket york minster was a full-grown 
short thick powerful man his disposition was reserved taciturn 
morose and when excited violently passionate his affections were very
strong towards a few friends on board his intellect good jemmy
button was a universal favourite but likewise passionate the
expression of his face at once showed his nice disposition he was
merry and often laughed and was remarkably sympathetic with any one in
pain when the water was rough i was often a little sea-sick and he
used to come to me and say in a plaintive voice poor poor fellow 
but the notion after his aquatic life of a man being sea-sick was
too ludicrous and he was generally obliged to turn on one side to hide
a smile or laugh and then he would repeat his poor poor fellow he
was of a patriotic disposition and he liked to praise his own tribe
and country in which he truly said there were plenty of trees and
he abused all the other tribes he stoutly declared that there was no
devil in his land jemmy was short thick and fat but vain of his
personal appearance he used always to wear gloves his hair was neatly
cut and he was distressed if his well-polished shoes were dirtied he
was fond of admiring himself in a looking glass and a merry-faced
little indian boy from the rio negro whom we had for some months on
board soon perceived this and used to mock him jemmy who was always
rather jealous of the attention paid to this little boy did not at all
like this and used to say with rather a contemptuous twist of his
head too much skylark it seems yet wonderful to me when i think
over all his many good qualities that he should have been of the same
race and doubtless partaken of the same character with the miserable 
degraded savages whom we first met here lastly fuegia basket was a
nice modest reserved young girl with a rather pleasing but sometimes
sullen expression and very quick in learning anything especially
languages this she showed in picking up some portuguese and spanish 
when left on shore for only a short time at rio de janeiro and monte
video and in her knowledge of english york minster was very jealous
of any attention paid to her for it was clear he determined to marry
her as soon as they were settled on shore 

although all three could both speak and understand a good deal of
english it was singularly difficult to obtain much information from
them concerning the habits of their countrymen this was partly owing
to their apparent difficulty in understanding the simplest alternative 
every one accustomed to very young children knows how seldom one can
get an answer even to so simple a question as whether a thing is black
or white the idea of black or white seems alternately to fill their
minds so it was with these fuegians and hence it was generally
impossible to find out by cross questioning whether one had rightly
understood anything which they had asserted their sight was
remarkably acute it is well known that sailors from long practice 
can make out a distant object much better than a landsman but both
york and jemmy were much superior to any sailor on board several times
they have declared what some distant object has been and though
doubted by every one they have proved right when it has been examined
through a telescope they were quite conscious of this power and
jemmy when he had any little quarrel with the officer on watch would
say me see ship me no tell 

it was interesting to watch the conduct of the savages when we landed 
towards jemmy button they immediately perceived the difference between
him and ourselves and held much conversation one with another on the
subject the old man addressed a long harangue to jemmy which it
seems was to invite him to stay with them but jemmy understood very
little of their language and was moreover thoroughly ashamed of his
countrymen when york minster afterwards came on shore they noticed
him in the same way and told him he ought to shave yet he had not
twenty dwarf hairs on his face whilst we all wore our untrimmed
beards they examined the colour of his skin and compared it with
ours one of our arms being bared they expressed the liveliest
surprise and admiration at its whiteness just in the same way in which
i have seen the ourangoutang do at the zoological gardens we thought
that they mistook two or three of the officers who were rather shorter
and fairer though adorned with large beards for the ladies of our
party the tallest amongst the fuegians was evidently much pleased at
his height being noticed when placed back to back with the tallest of
the boat s crew he tried his best to edge on higher ground and to
stand on tiptoe he opened his mouth to show his teeth and turned his
face for a side view and all this was done with such alacrity that i
dare say he thought himself the handsomest man in tierra del fuego 
after our first feeling of grave astonishment was over nothing could
be more ludicrous than the odd mixture of surprise and imitation which
these savages every moment exhibited
